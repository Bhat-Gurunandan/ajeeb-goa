<h1 class="chapter-title"><a href="toc.xhtml#toc-chapter002">FROM THE MOUTH OF THE SHARK</a></h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="small-caps">IGRATION IS BIG NEWS</span>, big enough to drive the politics of much of Europe and the United States. Between President Donald Trump’s imaginary but enormously consequential hordes of murderous Mexican migrants and the anti-foreigner rhetoric of the Alternative for Germany, the French Rassemblement National, and the Brexit crew, not to mention the ruling parties in Italy, Hungary, and Slovakia, it may be the single most influential political issue in the world’s richest countries. Even politicians from the mainstream European parties are struggling to reconcile the liberal traditions they want to uphold with the threat they see across their shores. It is less visible in the developing world, but the fights over Zimbabwean refugees in South Africa, the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, and the citizenship bill in Assam, India, have been equally frightening for those who are its targets.</p>
<p>Why the panic? The fraction of international migrants in the world population in 2017 was roughly what it was in 1960 or in 1990: 3 percent.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0014en" id="en0014"><sup>1</sup></a> The European Union (EU) on average gets between 1.5 million and 2.5 million non-EU migrants every year from the rest of the world. Two and a half million is less than one half of one percent of the EU population. Most of these are legal migrants, people with job offers, or those who arrive to join their families. There was an unusual influx of refugees in 2015 and 2016, but by 2018 the number of asylum seekers to the EU was back to 638,000, and only 38 percent of the requests were granted.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0015en" id="en0015"><sup>2</sup></a> This represents about one for every twenty-five hundred EU residents. That’s it. Hardly a deluge.</p>
<p><a id="page-11"/>Racist alarmism, driven by a fear of the intermingling of races and the myth of purity, doesn’t heed facts. A survey of 22,500 native respondents from six countries where immigration has been a defining political issue (France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) revealed massive misperceptions about the number and composition of immigrants.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0016en" id="en0016"><sup>3</sup></a> For instance, in Italy, the actual share of immigrants in the population is 10 percent, but the average perception of that share is 26 percent.</p>
<p>Respondents starkly overestimate the share of Muslim immigrants, as well as the share of immigrants coming from the Middle East and North Africa. They believe immigrants are less educated, poorer, more likely to be unemployed, and more likely to live on government handouts than they actually are.</p>
<p>Politicians stoke these fears by abusing the facts. In the run-up to the 2017 French presidential election, Marine Le Pen frequently claimed that 99 percent of immigrants were adult males (58 percent were), and that 95 percent of migrants who settled in France were “taken care of by the nation” because they wouldn’t work in France (in reality, 55 percent of migrants in France were in the labor force).<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0017en" id="en0017"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Two recent experiments show this is a winning electoral tactic, even in a world of systematic fact-checking. In one study in the United States, researchers worked with two sets of questions. One set aimed to solicit respondents’ <em>opinions</em> about migration, the other their <em>factual knowledge</em> of the numbers and characteristics of migrants.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0018en" id="en0018"><sup>5</sup></a> Those who answered the fact-based questions first, before being asked their opinion (and thus reminded of their own distorted perceptions about migrants) were significantly more likely to be against immigration. When they were told the true numbers, their sense of the facts changed, but not their bottom-line views on immigration. In France, a parallel experiment found something similar. People deliberately exposed to Marine Le Pen’s false claims were more likely to want to vote for her.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0019en" id="en0019"><sup>6</sup></a> Sadly, this persisted after her statements were fact-checked in front of them. Truth did not sway their opinions. Simply thinking about migration makes people more parochial. The facts aren’t allowed to get in the way.</p>
<p><a id="page-12"/>There is an important reason why facts are ignored, and it is based on a piece of economics seemingly so utterly self-evident that many find it impossible to think past it, even when the evidence says the opposite. The economic analysis of immigration often comes down to a seductive syllogism. The world is full of poor people who would obviously earn a lot more if they could find their way here (wherever that might be), where things are clearly much better; therefore, given half a chance, they will indeed leave wherever they are and come to our country, and this will drive down wages and make most of us already here worse off.</p>
<p>What is remarkable about this argument is its faithfulness to the standard exposition of the law of supply and demand, as taught in high school economics. People want more money and therefore will all go wherever wages are highest (supply goes up). As the demand curve for labor slopes down, the rise in the labor supply will lower wages for everyone. The migrants may benefit, but the native workers will suffer. This is the sentiment President Trump tries to capture when he insists the country is “full.” The reasoning is so simple it can fit on the back of a very small napkin, as in <a href="#fig2_1">figure 2.1.</a></p>
<p>The logic is simple, seductive, and wrong. First, wage differences between countries (or locations, more generally) actually have relatively little to do with whether or not people migrate. While there are obviously many people desperate to get out from wherever they are, as we will see, the enduring puzzle is why so many others <em>don’t</em> move when they can.</p>

<p><a id="page-13"/>Second, there is no credible evidence that even relatively large inflows of low-skilled migrants hurt the local population, including members of the local population most like the migrants in terms of skills. Indeed, migration seems to make most people, migrants and locals, better off. This has a lot to do with the peculiar nature of the labor market. Very little about it fits the standard story of supply and demand.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a001">LEAVING HOME</h1>
<p class="noindent">The British Somali poet, Warsan Shire, wrote:</p>
<div class="linegroup">
<p class="line">no one leaves home unless</p>
<p class="line">home is the mouth of a shark</p>
<p class="line">you only run for the border</p>
<p class="line">when you see the whole city running as well</p>
<p class="line">your neighbors running faster than you</p>
<p class="line">breath bloody in their throats</p>
<p class="line">the boy you went to school with</p>
<p class="line">who kissed you dizzy behind the old tin factory</p>
<p class="line">is holding a gun bigger than his body</p>
<p class="line">you only leave home</p>
<p class="line">when home won’t let you stay.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0020en" id="en0020"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>She was clearly onto something. The places people seem most desperate to leave—countries like Iraq, Syria, Guatemala, and even Yemen—are far from being the poorest in the world. Per capita income in Iraq, after adjusting for differences in cost of living (what economists call <em>purchasing power parity</em>, or PPP), is about twenty times that in Liberia, and at least ten times as high as in Mozambique or Sierra Leone. In 2016, despite a dramatic fall in income, Yemen was still three times richer than Liberia (there is no data for more recent years). Mexico, President Trump’s favorite target, is an upper-middle-income country with a much praised and widely imitated welfare system.</p>
<p>Those trying to get out of such places probably don’t face the grinding extreme poverty the average Liberian or Mozambique resident <a id="page-14"/>faces. It is more that they find life intolerable because of the collapse of everyday normality: the unpredictability and violence brought upon them by the drug wars in Northern Mexico, the horrible military Junta in Guatemala, and the civil wars in the Middle East. A study from Nepal found that even bad years in agriculture didn’t drive many Nepalis out of the country.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0021en" id="en0021"><sup>8</sup></a> In fact, fewer people left in bad years because they could not afford the trip out. It is only when the violence from Nepal’s long-standing Maoist insurgency flared up that people started leaving. They were running from the mouth of the shark. And when that happens, it is almost impossible to stop them, because in their minds there is no home to return to.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the opposite: the ambitious migrant who needs to get out at all costs. This is Apu, the protagonist of <em>Aparajito</em>, the second of Satyajit Ray’s wonderful Apu trilogy, caught between his lonely mother in their village home and the many exciting possibilities offered by the city.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0022en" id="en0022"><sup>9</sup></a> This is the migrant from China who works two jobs and scrimps and saves so his children one day can go to Harvard. We all know such people exist.</p>
<p>And then there are the people in the middle, the vast majority who don’t face extreme internal or external compulsions to move. They do not seem to go chasing after every extra dollar. Even where there are no border checks and no immigration agents to dodge, they stay where they are, in the countryside, for example, despite the large wage gaps that exist <em>within the same country</em>, between rural and urban areas.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0023en" id="en0023"><sup>10</sup></a> In Delhi, a survey of slum dwellers, many of them recent migrants from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the two enormous states to the east of Delhi, found that after paying for housing, the average family lived on slightly over $2 a day (at PPP).<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0024en" id="en0024"><sup>11</sup></a> This is much more than the bottom 30 percent in those two states, who live on less than $1 a day at PPP. Yet the rest of the very poor people (of whom there are about a hundred million) have not opted to move to Delhi and more than double their earnings.</p>
<p>It is not only in developing countries that people do not move to take advantage of better economic conditions. Fewer than 350,000 Greeks are estimated to have emigrated between 2010 and 2015, at the height of the economic crisis that shook their country.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0025en" id="en0025"><sup>12</sup></a> This represents at most 3 percent of Greece’s population, despite the fact that <a id="page-15"/>the unemployment rate was 27 percent in 2013 and 2014, and Greeks, as members of the EU, are able to work and move freely within Europe.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a002">THE MIGRATION LOTTERY</h1>
<p class="noindent">But maybe there is no puzzle here; maybe we overestimate the benefits of migration. An important general problem in assessing the benefits of migration is that we usually only focus on the wages of those who chose to move, and not on the many reasons that made them do so, and the many things that made it possible for them to do so successfully. Those who migrate may have special skills or unusual stamina and would therefore earn more, even if they had stayed home. While migrants do many things that do not require particular skills, their jobs often involve hard, backbreaking work calling for great stamina and patience (think of construction or fruit picking, the jobs many migrants from Latin America do in the United States). Not everyone can do it day after day.</p>
<p>Therefore, one cannot naively compare the earnings of migrants with the earnings of those who remain in their home location and conclude, as many cheerleaders for more migration have, that the benefits of more migration must be enormous. This is what economists call an <em>identification problem</em>. To be able to claim a difference in wages is <em>caused</em> by the difference in the location and nothing else, we need to establish an exact connection between the cause and the effect.</p>
<p>One easy way to do this is to study visa lotteries. Winners and losers in a lottery tend to be identical in every way except for this one piece of luck, and therefore the difference in earnings resulting from winning the visa lottery cannot be due to anything other than the change of location it facilitates. Comparing winners and losers of the New Zealand visa lottery, for applicants from the tiny South Pacific island of Tonga (most of them quite poor), a study found that within one year of moving, winners more than trebled their income.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0026en" id="en0026"><sup>13</sup></a> At the other end of the earnings spectrum, Indian software professionals who got to work in the United States because they won the visa lottery made six times more money than their peers who stayed in India.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0027en" id="en0027"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a003"><a id="page-16"/>LAVA BOMBS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The problem with these numbers is also what makes them easy to interpret: they rely on comparisons among those who <em>applied</em> for visa lotteries. But those who don’t apply may be very different. They may have little to gain from migrating, say, because they do not have the right skills. There are, however, some very revealing studies of people forced to move by an act of pure chance.</p>
<p>On January 23, 1973, there was a volcanic eruption in the Westman Islands, a prosperous fishing archipelago off the coast of Iceland. The Westman Islands’ fifty-two hundred inhabitants were evacuated within four hours and only one person died, but the eruption lasted for five months, and lava destroyed about one-third of the houses on the islands. The houses destroyed were those on the eastern part (directly in the flow of the lava), plus some houses elsewhere that were hit by random “lava bombs.” There is no way to build a house that resists lava, so destruction was entirely determined by location and bad luck. There seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary about the eastern neighborhood; destroyed houses had the same market value as nondestroyed houses, and their inhabitants were the same kinds of people. This is what social scientists call a <em>natural experiment</em>: nature has thrown the dice, and we can safely assume there was nothing different ex ante between those who had their houses destroyed and those who did not.</p>
<p>But there was an important difference afterward. Those whose houses were destroyed were given cash corresponding to the value of their houses and land, which they could use to rebuild or buy another house, or to move wherever they pleased. Forty-two percent of those whose houses were destroyed chose to move (and 27 percent of those whose houses were not destroyed moved anyway).<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0028en" id="en0028"><sup>15</sup></a> Iceland is a small but well-organized country, and using tax and other records it is possible to follow the long-term economic trajectories of all the original inhabitants of the Westman Islands. Impressively, exhaustive genetic data also allows matching to their parents every descendant of those caught in the eruption.</p>
<p>Using this data, researchers found that for anybody who was under twenty-five at the time of the eruption, losing a house led to <em>large economic gains</em>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0029en" id="en0029"><sup>16</sup></a> By 2014, those whose parental houses were destroyed <a id="page-17"/>earned over $3,000 per year more than those whose parental houses were not destroyed, even though not all of them moved. The effect was concentrated on those who were young when it happened. This is partly because they were more likely to have attended college. It also seems that having to move made it more likely they found a job they were good at instead of just becoming fishermen, the one thing most people do in the Westman Islands. This would have been much easier for a young person who had not yet invested years in learning fishing. Still, people needed to be forced out (by the random munificence of the lava); those who kept their houses mostly remained, as many generations before them had, fishing and getting by.</p>
<p>An even more remarkable example of this kind of inertia comes from Finland in the years just following the Second World War. As a result of fighting on the losing German side in the war, Finland was forced to cede a substantial part of its territory to the Soviet Union. The entire population of that area, some 430,000 people, 11 percent of the nation’s population, had to be evacuated and resettled in the rest of the country.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0030en" id="en0030"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Before the war, the displaced population was, if anything, less urbanized and less likely to have formal employment than the rest of Finland’s people, but was otherwise very similar. Twenty-five years on, in spite of the bruises this hurried and chaotic exit must have left, the displaced population was richer than the rest, mainly because they were more likely to be mobile, urban, and formally employed. Being forced to move seemed to have loosened their moorings and made them more adventurous.</p>
<p>That it takes a disaster scenario or a war to motivate people to gravitate to a location with the highest wages shows economic incentives on their own are often not sufficient to get people to move.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a004">DO THEY KNOW?</h1>
<p class="noindent">Of course, one possibility is that poorer people are simply unaware of the opportunity to improve their economic situation by moving. An interesting field experiment in Bangladesh makes it clear this is not the only reason they don’t move.</p>
<p><a id="page-18"/>There is no legal barrier to migration within Bangladesh. Yet, even during the lean season, commonly referred to as <em>monga</em> (“season of hunger”) when there are very few opportunities to earn money in rural areas, few people migrate to the cities, which offer low-skill employment opportunities in construction and transportation; or even to neighboring rural areas that may have a different crop cycle. To understand why and to encourage seasonal migration, researchers decided to try out different ways of encouraging migration during monga in Rangpur in the north of Bangladesh.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0031en" id="en0031"><sup>18</sup></a> Some villagers were randomly selected by a local nongovernmental organization (NGO) to either receive information about the benefits of migration (basically what the wages were like in the cities), or the same information plus $11.50 in cash or credit (this amount was roughly the cost of travel to the city and a couple of days of food), but only <em>if they migrated</em>.</p>
<p>The offer encouraged about a quarter (22 percent) of all households who would not have otherwise done so to send out a migrant. Most of those who migrated succeeded in finding employment. On average, those in the group who left earned about $105 during their migration, far more than they would had they stayed home. They sent or brought back $66 of that money to the families they left behind. As a result, the families who sent an extra migrant consumed on average an amazing 50 percent more calories; these families went from near starvation to a comfortable level of food consumption.</p>
<p>But why did the migrants need the extra push from the NGO to decide to make the trip? Why was near starvation not enough of an impetus?</p>
<p>In this case, it is very clear that information was not the binding constraint. When the NGO provided a randomly chosen group of people with information about the availability of jobs (but no incentive), the information alone had absolutely no effect. Moreover, among the people given the financial support who chose to make the trip, only around half went back during the next monga season, despite their personal experience of finding a job and making money. For these people, at least, it could not be skepticism about the job opportunities that held them back.</p>
<p>In other words, despite the fact that those who do migrate, forced or otherwise, gain economically, it is hard to take seriously the idea <a id="page-19"/>that most people are just waiting for an occasion to give up everything and head to a richer country. Given the size of the economic rewards, there are many fewer migrants than we would expect. Something else must hold them back—we will return to this puzzle later. Before we come to that, it is useful to understand how the labor market for migrants functions, and in particular whether the gains migrants make arise at the expense of the natives, as many seem to believe.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a005">LIFT ALL THE BOATS?</h1>
<p class="noindent">This question has been the object of a vigorous debate in the economics profession, but overall the evidence seems to suggest even large bouts of in-migration have very little negative impact on the wages or employment prospects of the population the immigrants join.</p>
<p>The debate continues mainly because it is not usually easy to tell. Countries restrict migration, and in particular they are less likely to let people in when the economy is doing badly. Migrants also vote with their feet, and their natural tendency is to go where there are better options. For a combination of these two reasons, if you plotted the wages of nonmigrants in cities against the share of migrants in cities, you would find a nice upward-sloping line; the more migrants, the higher the wages. Good news for the pro-migration view, but perhaps entirely spurious.</p>
<p>To find out the real impact of immigration on the wages of the natives, we need to look for changes in migration that are not a direct response to the wages in that city. And even that may not be enough, because both current residents and firms also vote with their feet. It could be, for example, that the influx of migrants drives out so many native workers from the city that wages do not fall for those who stay behind. If we looked only at the wages of those natives who chose to stay in the cities where migrants settled, we would entirely miss the pain of those who decided to leave. It is also possible the new migrant population attracts firms into a city at the cost of other cities, and we could miss the cost to the workers in those other cities.</p>
<p>A clever attempt to get around some of these issues is David Card’s study of the Mariel boatlift.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0032en" id="en0032"><sup>19</sup></a> Between April and September of 1980, <a id="page-20"/>125,000 Cubans, mostly with little or no education, arrived in Miami, after Fidel Castro unexpectedly gave a speech authorizing them to leave if they wished to. The reaction was immediate. The speech was delivered on April 20 and by the end of April people were already leaving. Many of the boatlifted settled permanently in Miami. The Miami labor force increased by 7 percent.</p>
<p>What happened to wages? To find out, Card took what has come to be called a “difference in differences” approach. He compared the evolution of wages and the rate of employment of prior residents in Miami, before and after the arrival of the migrants, to the same trajectory for residents in four other “similar” cities in the United States (Atlanta, Houston, Los Angeles, and Tampa). The idea was to see if the growth in wages and jobs for all those already in Miami when the Marielitos showed up fell behind the growth in wages and jobs of comparable residents in those four other cities.</p>
<p>Card found no difference, either immediately after the immigrants arrived or some years later; the wages of natives were not affected by the arrival of the Marielitos. That was also true when he specifically looked at the wages of Cuban immigrants who had come over before this episode, who were probably the most similar to the new wave of Cuban arrivals and hence the most likely to be adversely affected by a new influx of immigrants.</p>
<p>This study was an important step toward providing a robust answer to the question of the impact of migration. Miami was not chosen for its employment opportunities; it was just the closest landing point for the Cubans. The boatlift was unexpected, so workers and firms did not have a chance to react to it, at least in the short run (the workers by leaving, the firms by moving in). Card’s study was very influential, both for its approach and for its conclusion. It was the first to show the supply-demand model might not directly apply to immigration.</p>
<p>No doubt as a result, the study was also extensively debated, with multiple rounds of rebuttals and counter-rebuttals. Perhaps no other single empirical study in economics has generated quite so much back and forth, and so much passion. A long-standing critic of the Mariel boatlift study is George Borjas, a vocal supporter of policies to shut out low-skilled migrants. Borjas reanalyzed the Mariel episode, including a larger set of cities for comparison and focusing specifically on <a id="page-21"/>non-Hispanic male high school dropouts, on the grounds they were the group we should be most concerned about.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0033en" id="en0033"><sup>20</sup></a> In that sample, he found that wages started going down very steeply in Miami after the boatlift arrived, compared to what was happening in the comparison cities. But a subsequent reanalysis showed these new results once again get reversed when data about Hispanic high school dropouts (who would seem to be the most obvious people to compare Cuban migrants with, but are for some reason omitted by Borjas) and women (again omitted by Borjas for no clear reason) are included.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0034en" id="en0034"><sup>21</sup></a> Moreover, studies continue to find no wage or employment effects when comparing Miami to a different set of cities where wages and employment were on very similar trends to Miami before the boatlift.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0035en" id="en0035"><sup>22</sup></a> Borjas however remains unconvinced, and the debate over the Mariel boatlift continues.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0036en" id="en0036"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>If you are not entirely sure of what to make of all this, you are not alone. To be blunt, it does not help that no one on either side ever changes their mind, and that opinions seem aligned with political views. Either way, it seems unreasonable to hang the future of migration policy on one episode that occurred thirty years ago in one city.</p>
<p>Fortunately, inspired by Card’s work, a number of other scholars tried to identify similar episodes where migrants or refugees were sent to a place with little warning and no controls over where they should go. There is a study examining the repatriation to France of Algerians of European origin resulting from Algeria’s independence from France in 1962.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0037en" id="en0037"><sup>24</sup></a> Another study looked at the impact of massive immigration from the Soviet Union to Israel after the Soviet Union lifted the emigration restriction in 1990, which increased Israel’s population by 12 percent in a space of four years.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0038en" id="en0038"><sup>25</sup></a> Yet another looked at the impact of the large influx of European immigrants into the United States during the age of the great migration (1910–1930).<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0039en" id="en0039"><sup>26</sup></a> In all of these cases, the researchers found very little adverse impact on the local population. In fact, sometimes the impacts were positive. For example, the European migrants to the United States increased overall employment in the native population, made it more likely natives would become foremen or managers, and increased industrial production.</p>
<p>There is also similar evidence from the more recent influx of refugees from all over the world on the native population in Western Europe. One particularly intriguing study looks at Denmark.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0040en" id="en0040"><sup>27</sup></a> Denmark <a id="page-22"/>is a remarkable country in many ways, and one of them is that it keeps detailed records of each member of its population. Historically, refugees used to be sent to different cities without regard for their preferences or their ability to find a job. All that mattered was the availability of public housing and the administrative capacity to help them settle down. Between 1994 and 1998, there was a large influx of immigrants from countries as diverse as Bosnia, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Lebanon, and they ended up sprinkled, more or less randomly, across Denmark. When the policy of administrative placement was abandoned in 1998, migrants most often went where their co-ethnics were already located. Therefore, the places where the first group of migrants from, say, Iraq had landed more or less by pure chance are where the new Iraqi migrants headed. As a result, some places in Denmark ended up getting a lot more migrants than others, for no good reason other than at some time between 1994 and 1998, they had spare capacity for resettlement.</p>
<p>This study came to the same conclusion as the historical ones. Comparing the evolution of wages and employment of less-educated natives in cities subject to this chance influx of migrants to those in other cities, it found no evidence of negative impacts.</p>
<p>Each of these studies suggests low-skilled immigrants generally do not hurt the wages and employment of the natives. But the level of rhetorical fervor in the current political debate, never mind whether it is supported by the facts, makes it hard to see past the politics of the people involved in the debate. Where, then, is there a calm, methodical voice to be found? Readers interested in the delicate art of consensus building in the economics profession may want to peruse <a href="chapter008.xhtml#page-267">page 267</a> of the (free) report on the impact of immigration edited by the US National Academy of Sciences, the most respected body for academics in the country.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0041en" id="en0041"><sup>28</sup></a> From time to time, the National Academy of Sciences convenes panels to summarize the scientific consensus on an issue. The panel for the immigration report had some fans of immigration and some immigration skeptics (including George Borjas). They had to make sure to cover the good, the bad, and the ugly, and their sentences often thread a long-winded path, but their conclusion is as close to unequivocal as you are ever going to get from a group of economists:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><a id="page-23"/>“Empirical research in recent decades suggests that findings remain by and large consistent with those in The New Americans National Research Council (1997) in that, when measured over a period of more than 10 years, the impact of immigration on the wages of natives overall is very small.”</p>
</div>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a006">WHAT’S SO SPECIAL ABOUT IMMIGRANTS?</h1>
<p class="noindent">Why does the classic supply-demand theory (the more of something you have, the lower the price) not apply to immigration? It is important to get to the bottom of this question, because even if it is clearly true that low-skill wages are unaffected by immigration, unless we know <em>why,</em> we will always wonder if there was something special about these circumstances or the data.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors that turn out to be relevant, which the basic supply-demand framework sweeps under the rug. First, the influx of a new group of workers will typically shift the demand curve to the right, which will help undo the effect of the downward slope. The newcomers spend money: they go to restaurants, they get haircuts, they go shopping. This creates jobs, and mostly jobs for other low-skilled people. As illustrated in <a href="#fig2_2">figure 2.2</a>, this tends to increase their wages and perhaps thus compensate for the shift in the labor supply, leaving wages and unemployment unchanged.</p>

<p class="caption"><a id="fig2_2"/>FIGURE 2.2 Napkin economics redux. Why more migrants do not always lead to lower wages.</p>
<p><a id="page-24"/>In fact, there is evidence that if the demand channel is shut down, migration may indeed have the “expected” negative effect on natives. For a short period of time, Czech workers were allowed to work across the border in Germany. At its peak, in the border towns of Germany, up to 10 percent of the workforce was commuting from the Czech Republic. There was very little change in wages for natives when this happened, but there was a large drop in native employment because, unlike all the other episodes we discussed above, the Czechs went back home to spend their earnings. Therefore, the knock-on effects on labor demand in Germany did not happen. The immigrants may not produce growth for their new communities unless they spend their earnings there; if the money is repatriated, the economic benefits of immigration are lost to the host community.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0042en" id="en0042"><sup>29</sup></a> We will then find ourselves back in the case of <a href="#fig2_1">figure 2.1</a>, where we are traveling the downward-sloping labor demand curve without a shift in labor demand to compensate.</p>
<p>A second reason why low-skilled migration might push up the demand for labor is that it slows down the process of mechanization. The promise of a reliable supply of low-wage workers makes it less attractive to adopt labor-saving technologies. In December 1964, Mexican immigrant farm laborers, the <em>braceros</em>, were kicked out of California, precisely on the grounds that they were depressing wages for native Californians. Their exit did nothing for the natives: wages and employment did not go up.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0043en" id="en0043"><sup>30</sup></a> The reason is that as soon as the braceros were thrown out, farms in places that used to rely heavily on them did two things. First, they mechanized production. For example, for tomatoes, harvesting machines that could double the productivity per worker had existed since the 1950s, but adoption was very slow. In California, adoption rates went from near 0 percent in 1964, exactly when the braceros left, to 100 percent in 1967, while in Ohio, where there had been no braceros to speak of, adoption did not change at all during those years. Second, they switched out of the crops for which mechanization was not available. This is how California, at least temporarily, gave up on such delicacies as asparagus, fresh strawberries, lettuce, celery, and pickling cucumbers.</p>
<p>A third, closely related point is that employers may want to reorganize production to make effective use of the new workers, which can <a id="page-25"/>create new roles for the native low-skilled population. In the Danish case we discussed above, Danish low-skilled workers eventually benefited from the influx of migrants, in part because it enabled them to change their occupations.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0044en" id="en0044"><sup>31</sup></a> Where there were more migrants around, more native low-skilled workers upgraded from manual to nonmanual jobs and changed employers. While doing so, they also shifted to jobs with more complex tasks and that required more communication and technical content; this is consistent with the fact that the immigrants hardly spoke Danish when they first arrived and could not be rivals for these jobs. The same kind of occupational upgrading also happened during the great European migration to the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
<p>More generally, what this suggests is that low-skilled natives and immigrants do not have to compete directly. They may perform different tasks, with immigrants specializing in tasks requiring less communication and natives in tasks that do. The availability of immigrants may actually encourage firms to hire more workers; the immigrants perform the simpler tasks, and the natives switch to complementary, more rewarding tasks.</p>
<p>Fourth, another way in which migrants complement rather than compete with native labor is they are willing to perform tasks natives are reluctant to carry out; they mow lawns, flip burgers, attend to the needs of babies or sick people. So when there are more migrants, the price of those services tends to go down, which helps the native workers and frees them to take on other jobs.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0045en" id="en0045"><sup>32</sup></a> Highly skilled women, in particular, are more likely to be able to go out to work when there are many migrants around.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0046en" id="en0046"><sup>33</sup></a> The entry of highly skilled women to the labor market in turn boosts demand for low-skilled labor (childcare, catering, cleaning) at home or in the firms they manage or run.</p>
<p>The effects of migrants will also crucially depend on who the migrants are. If the most enterprising move, they may start businesses that create jobs for the natives. If they are the least qualified, they might have to join the undifferentiated mass that native low-skilled workers will have to compete against.</p>
<p>Who migrates typically depends on the barriers migrants have to overcome. When President Trump compared the migrants from “shithole countries” to the good ones coming from Norway, he most <a id="page-26"/>probably did not know that a long time ago Norwegian immigrants were part of the “huddled masses” Emma Lazarus talked about.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0047en" id="en0047"><sup>34</sup></a> There is actually a case study of Norwegian migrants to the United States during the age of mass migration, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0048en" id="en0048"><sup>35</sup></a> At the time, there was nothing to stop migration, other than the price of passage. The study compared the families of migrants to the families where nobody migrated. It found migrants tended to come from among the poorest families; their fathers were substantially poorer than average. So, by one of the cute ironies historians (and economists) delight in, Norwegian migrants were exactly the kinds of people Trump would instinctively prefer to keep away. In his eyes, they would have been the “shithole people” of their day.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who migrate out of poor countries today need to have the money to afford the cost of travel and have the grit (or the advanced degrees) required to overcome a system of immigration control typically loaded against them. For this reason, a lot of them bring exceptional talents—skills, ambition, patience, and stamina—that help them become job creators, or raise children who will be job creators. A report by the Center for American Entrepreneurship found that, in 2017, out of the largest five hundred US companies by revenue (the Fortune 500 list), 43 percent were founded or co-founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants. Moreover, immigrant-founded firms account for 52 percent of the top twenty-five firms, 57 percent of the top thirty-five firms, and nine of the top thirteen most valuable brands.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0049en" id="en0049"><sup>36</sup></a> Henry Ford was the son of an Irish immigrant. Steve Jobs’s biological father was from Syria, Sergey Brin was born in Russia. Jeff Bezos takes his name from his stepfather, the Cuban immigrant Mike Bezos.</p>
<p>And even among those not so special to start with, the fact of being an immigrant, in a foreign location, without the social ties that make life richer but also impose limits on the single-minded pursuit of one’s career, can liberate one to try something new and different. Abhijit knows of many middle-class Bengali men who, like him, had never washed their own dishes before leaving home. But, finding themselves short of money and long on time in some British or American town, they ended up bussing tables in a local restaurant and discovered they quite liked doing something more hands-on than the white-collar job <a id="page-27"/>they had imagined for themselves. Perhaps the reverse happened to the Icelandic would-be fishermen who, thrown into an unfamiliar place where many more people were going to college, decided it might not be such a bad idea after all.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0050en" id="en0050"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>So one very big problem with the supply-demand analysis applied to immigration is that an influx of migrants increases the demand for labor at the same time it increases the supply of laborers. This is one reason why wages do not go down when there are more migrants. A deeper problem lies in the very nature of labor markets: supply-demand is just not a very good description of how they really work.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a007">WORKERS AND WATERMELONS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Traveling around Dhaka, Delhi, or Dakar in the early morning, you will sometimes notice groups of people, mostly men, crouching on the sidewalks near important crossings. They are job seekers, waiting to be picked up by someone who needs them for work, often in construction.</p>
<p>For a social scientist, what is striking, however, is how rare these physical labor markets are. Given there are nearly twenty million people in the greater Delhi area, one might imagine every street corner would have such an assemblage. In fact, one has to look around to find them.</p>
<p>Signs advertising jobs are also relatively rare in Delhi or Dakar. There are lots of ads on websites and employment portals, but most of those jobs are well out of the reach of the average rural goatherd. By contrast, in Boston the subway is full of announcements for job opportunities, but the ads challenge prospective employees to solve some seemingly impossible riddle to prove their intelligence. They want workers but they don’t want to make it too easy for them. This reflects something very fundamental about labor markets.</p>
<p>Hiring is different from buying, say, watermelons in a wholesale market, for at least two reasons. One is that the relationship with a worker lasts a lot longer than the purchase of a bag of watermelons; you can switch suppliers next week if you don’t like the melon you got. But even where the laws don’t make it difficult to fire a worker, firing is unpleasant at best, and potentially dangerous if the disgruntled <a id="page-28"/>employee becomes enraged. Therefore, most firms will not hire just anyone willing to work for them. They worry whether the worker will show up for work on time, whether the work will be up to snuff, whether they will fight with their colleagues, insult an important client, or break an expensive machine. Second, the quality of a worker is harder to judge than that of watermelons (which professional watermelon sellers are apparently very good at assessing<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0051en" id="en0051"><sup>38</sup></a>). Despite what Karl Marx had to say, labor is no ordinary commodity.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0052en" id="en0052"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>Firms therefore need to put in some effort to know whom they are hiring. In the case of more highly paid workers, this means they spend time and money on interviews, tests, references, and so forth. This is costly both for the firms and the workers, and seems to be universal. In Ethiopia, a study found that just applying for a midlevel clerical job took several days and repeated journeys. Each application cost the would-be applicant a tenth of the monthly wage he would earn and had a very low probability of leading to a hire, one reason why few people applied.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0053en" id="en0053"><sup>40</sup></a> For this reason, in the case of lower-paid workers, firms often skip the interview and rely on the recommendation of someone they trust. Relatively few firms hire those who just walk in and ask for a job, <em>even if they say they would accept a lower wage</em>. This of course flies in the face of the standard supply-demand framework. But it is too costly to be put in a position where the employer might want to get rid of a worker. In a striking example, researchers trying to find firms in Ethiopia willing to randomize whom they hired, approached over three hundred firms before they found <em>five</em> that were willing to join the experiment.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0054en" id="en0054"><sup>41</sup></a> These were jobs where no specific skills were needed, but the firms still wanted to retain some control over whom they hired. Evidence from other studies in Ethiopia suggests 56 percent of firms insist on work experience even for blue-collar jobs,<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0055en" id="en0055"><sup>42</sup></a> and it is also common to ask for a referral from an employer.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0056en" id="en0056"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>This has several important implications. First, established workers are much more secure from competition from newcomers than a pure supply-demand model would have us believe. Their current employer knows them and trusts them; incumbency is a huge advantage.</p>
<p>From the point of view of a migrant this is bad news. To make matters worse, there is a second implication. Think of what an employer <a id="page-29"/>can do to punish a worker who is not performing; at worst he can fire the employee. But firing will only be adequate punishment if the job pays enough for the worker to really want to keep it. As the future Nobel Prize–winner Joe Stiglitz pointed out many years ago, firms would not want to pay their workers the minimum the workers would accept, precisely to avoid being in the position captured by that old Soviet joke: “They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work.”</p>
<p>This logic says that the wage the firm must pay to get workers to work typically has to be high enough that being fired actually hurts. This is what economists call the <em>efficiency wage.</em> As a result, the wage difference between what firms pay their established workers and what they would need to pay a newcomer may not be very large, because they cannot risk the consequences of paying a newcomer too little.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0057en" id="en0057"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>This makes the incentive to employ a prospective migrant even weaker. Moreover, employers are also reluctant to have large differences in wages within their establishments, for fear of lowering morale. Evidence suggests that workers hate inequality within firms, even if the inequality is related to productivity, at least when the link between pay and productivity is not immediately obvious and transparent.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0058en" id="en0058"><sup>45</sup></a> And unhappy workers do not make for a productive workplace. This contributes to why native workers are not quickly replaced by cheaper immigrants.</p>
<p>This discussion fits nicely with another finding from the Czech migration study mentioned before: job losses for natives were not actually losses; they were, rather, lower gains (compared to regions of Germany where Czechs did not go).<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0059en" id="en0059"><sup>46</sup></a> German firms did not replace their existing staff with Czech migrants. Those already employed in Germany still had the benefit of familiarity. What happened was that instead of hiring new native workers whom they did not know, German firms sometimes hired Czechs whom they also did not know.</p>
<p>The view that there is not much scope for migrants to get the jobs natives already hold, even by offering to do them for lower wages, also helps us understand why immigrants often end up in jobs natives do not want, or in cities no one wants to go to. There, they are not taking jobs from anyone; those jobs would remain unfilled if there were no migrants willing to take them.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a008"><a id="page-30"/>THE SKILLED SET</h1>
<p class="noindent">So far we have been talking of the impact of unskilled migrants on natives. But even those who oppose unskilled migration are usually in favor of skilled migrants. Many of the arguments we made to explain why low-skilled migrants do not compete with low-skilled natives do not apply to skilled ones. For one, they are typically paid much more than the minimum wage. There may not be a need to pay them an efficiency wage because their jobs are exciting, and getting a chance to do them and doing them well would be its own reward. Therefore, there is paradoxically more scope for a skilled migrant to undercut the wages of the natives. Second, for skilled workers, the employer cares relatively more about the exact skill set of the person being hired than about the applicant’s personality or reliability. Most hospitals hiring a nurse, for example, will focus primarily on whether the applicant meets the legal requirements for the job (in particular, whether they have taken and passed the nursing board exam). If a foreign-born nurse with the right certification is available for less, the hospital has little reason not to go for that nurse. Moreover, no one hires such workers without a series of interviews and tests, putting unknown workers on the same footing as familiar or connected ones.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is no surprise that in the United States one study finds that, for every skilled, qualified foreign nurse employed in a city, there are between one and two fewer native-born nurses.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0060en" id="en0060"><sup>47</sup></a> In part this is because native-born students facing competition from nurses born and educated abroad are unwilling to sit for the nursing board exam in their states.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite widespread support for it, including from people like President Trump, the immigration of skilled workers is more of a mixed bag from the point of view of its impact on the domestic population. It helps low-skilled natives, who benefit from cheaper services (most doctors who serve the poorest corners of the United States are migrants from the developing world) at the cost of worsening the labor market prospects of the domestic population with similar skills (nurses, doctors, engineers, and college teachers).</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a009"><a id="page-31"/>WHAT CARAVAN?</h1>
<p class="noindent">The myths about immigration are crumbling. There is no evidence low-skilled migration to rich countries drives wage and employment down for the natives; nor are labor markets like fruit markets, and the laws of supply and demand do not apply. But the other reason immigration is so politically explosive is the idea that the numbers of would-be immigrants are overwhelming, that there is a flood of strangers, a horde of foreigners, a cacophony of alien languages and customs waiting to pour over our pristine monocultural borders.</p>
<p>Yet, as we saw, there is simply no evidence the hordes are waiting for a chance to descend on the shores of the United States (or the United Kingdom or France) and need to be kept out by force (or a wall). The fact is that unless there is a disaster pushing them out, most poor people prefer to stay home. They simply aren’t knocking on our door; they prefer their own countries. They don’t even necessarily want to move as far as their local capital city. People in rich countries find this so counterintuitive that they refuse to believe it, even when faced with the facts. What explains it?</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a010">WITHOUT CONNECTIONS</h1>
<p class="noindent">There are many reasons why people don’t move. All the things that make it hard for new immigrants to compete with long-term residents for jobs also discourage them from moving. For one, as we saw, it is not easy for an immigrant to find a decent job. The one exception is where the employer is a relative or a friend, or a friend of a friend, or at least a co-ethnic: someone who either knows or at least understands the migrant. For that reason, migrants tend to head to places where they have connections; finding a job is easier and they have help to land on their feet in the city. Of course, there are all kinds of reasons why the employment prospects of migrants from the same location will be correlated over time; for example, if a village produces great plumbers, both recent and previous generations of migrants will be employed, and employed in plumbing. But the pull of kinship is stronger. Kaivan <a id="page-32"/>Munshi, a professor at the University of Cambridge, and perhaps not coincidentally a member of the small and very tightly connected community of Zoroastrian Indians otherwise known as Parsis, demonstrated that Mexican migrants explicitly seek out people they might know.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0061en" id="en0061"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p>He observed that, regardless of opportunity in the United States, bad rains (disasters) have pushed people out of Mexico. When the rains failed in a particular village, a group of people left to seek other opportunities. Many of them ended up in the United States, with the result that a subsequent migrant from the same village would have connections in the US who were securely employed and able to help him or her find a job. Kaivan predicted that if one compares two villages in Mexico that have the same weather this year, <em>but one of them had a drought several years ago</em> (causing some villagers to emigrate) <em>while the other did not</em>, it will be easier for a resident of the village with the past drought to find a job (and also to find a better job) than for the resident of the village without the past drought. He expected to see more migrants, more employed migrants, and better-paid migrants. This is exactly what the data showed. Network connections matter.</p>
<p>The same applies to the resettlement of refugees; the ones most likely to find employment are those sent to a place with many older refugees from the same country.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0062en" id="en0062"><sup>49</sup></a> Those older refugees usually do not know their new countrymen, but they still feel compelled to help.</p>
<p>Connections are obviously useful for those who have them, but what happens to those who don’t? They will clearly be at a disadvantage. In fact, the presence of some people who come with recommendations can ruin the chances for everyone else. An employer used to workers coming with recommendations is likely to be suspicious of anyone without one. Knowing that, anyone who can get a recommendation would rather wait to get it (maybe some connection to a prospective employer will emerge; maybe a friend will start a business), and only those who know no one will ever recommend them (perhaps because they are actually not good workers) will go around knocking at doors to find a job. But then the employer would be right in refusing to talk to them.</p>
<p>The market in this situation is <em>unraveling</em>. In 1970, George Akerlof, another future Nobel laureate, but then just a fresh PhD, wrote a <a id="page-33"/>paper, “The Market for ‘Lemons,’” in which he argued that the market for used cars might just shut down because people have an incentive to sell off their worst cars. That sets off the kind of self-confirming reasoning we saw in the case of newcomers to the labor market; the more suspicious buyers become of the old cars being sold, the less they will want to pay for them.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0063en" id="en0063"><sup>50</sup></a> The problem is the less they want to pay, the more the owners of good used cars will want to hold on to them (or sell their cars to friends who know and trust them). Only those who know their car is about to collapse will want to sell on the open market. This process by which only the worst cars or the worst employees end up on the market is called <em>adverse selection</em>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0064en" id="en0064"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Connections are supposed to help people, but the fact that some have access to them and others do not may actually shut down a market that would function just fine if no one had connections. The playing field is level if there are no connections. Once some people have connections, the market can unravel, with the consequence that most people become unemployable.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a011">THE COMFORTS OF HOME</h1>
<p class="noindent">Abhijit once asked migrant respondents in Delhi slums what they liked about living in the city.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0065en" id="en0065"><sup>52</sup></a> They liked many things; there were more options to give their children a good education, health care was better, finding a job was easier. The one thing they did not like was the environment. This is no surprise. Delhi has some of the vilest air in the world.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0066en" id="en0066"><sup>53</sup></a> When asked about which problems in their living environment they wanted fixed first, 69 percent mentioned drains and sewers, and 54 percent complained about garbage removal. The combination of choked drains, absent sewers, and piled-up garbage are often what gives the slums in India (and elsewhere) their distinctive odor, somewhere between acrid and putrescent.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, many slum dwellers hesitate to bring their families with them. Instead, when it all becomes unbearable, as it must fairly quickly, they go home. In rural Rajasthan, the typical villager who migrates from the village to earn money comes back once a month.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0067en" id="en0067"><sup>54</sup></a> Only one out of ten migration episodes lasts more than three <a id="page-34"/>months. This means migrants tend to stay close to their home village, which probably limits the kinds of jobs they can get and the kinds of skills they acquire.</p>
<p>But why do they need to live in slums, or worse? Why don’t they rent themselves something a bit better? Often, even if they can afford it, the option doesn’t exist. In many developing countries, there are often several missing rungs in the quality ladder of housing. The next thing to a slum might be the nice little flat entirely out of reach.</p>
<p>There is a reason for this. Most third-world cities lack the infrastructure they need to serve their population. According to a recent report, India alone needs 4.5 trillion US dollars in infrastructure investment between 2016 and 2040, while Kenya needs 223 billion and Mexico 1.1 trillion.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0068en" id="en0068"><sup>55</sup></a> This means the relatively small parts of most cities with decent-quality infrastructure are always hugely in demand and have astronomically high land prices. Some of the most expensive real estate in the world, for example, is in India. Starved of investment, the rest of the city develops in haphazard ways, with the poor often squatting on whatever land happens to be unoccupied, whether or not it has sewer connections or water pipes. Desperate for a place to live but worried they can be evicted any day because it’s not their land, they build makeshift housing that sticks out like scars on the urban landscape. These are the famous third-world slums.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, as Ed Glaeser has argued in his wonderful book <em>Triumph of the City</em>, are city planners who resist building dense neighborhoods of high-rises for the middle class, aiming instead for a “garden city.”<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0069en" id="en0069"><sup>56</sup></a> India, for example, imposes draconian limits on how high buildings can be, much stricter than what is found in Paris, New York, or Singapore. These restrictions result in massive urban sprawl and long commutes in most Indian cities. The same problem also shows up in China and many other countries, albeit in a less extreme form.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0070en" id="en0070"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>For the would-be low-income migrant, this set of bad policy choices creates an unenviable trade-off. He can crowd into a slum (if he is lucky), commute many hours a day, or resign himself to the daily misery of sleeping under a bridge, on the floor of the building where he works, in his rickshaw or under his truck, or on the pavement, <a id="page-35"/>protected perhaps by the awning of a shop. If that is not discouraging enough, for reasons already discussed, low-skilled immigrants know that, at least to start out, the jobs they can get are the jobs nobody else wants. If you happen to be dropped somewhere without a choice you may take them on, but it is hard to get excited about abandoning friends and family and going to the end of the world to sleep under a bridge, clean floors, or bus tables. It is only the migrants with the ability to think past the immediate obstacles and pain, and contemplate a steady climb from busboy to restaurant chain owner, who typically take it on.</p>
<p>The attraction of home goes beyond creature comforts. Poor people often live very vulnerable lives. Their incomes tend to be volatile and their health precarious, making it very useful to be able to call on others for help when needed. The more connected you are, the less exposed you will be if something bad happens. You might have a network where you are going, but your network is probably deeper and stronger where you grew up. You (and your family) may lose access to that network if you leave. As a result, only the most desperate or the very well off who can afford the risk will leave.</p>
<p>Comfort and connections play the same limiting role for would-be international migrants, only much more so. If they leave, they must often leave alone, abandoning everything familiar or dear to them for many years to come.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0071en" id="en0071"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a012">FAMILY TIES</h1>
<p class="noindent">The nature of life in traditional communities may be another important drag on migration. The Caribbean economist Arthur Lewis, one of the pioneers in the field of development economics and the 1979 Nobel laureate, made the following simple observation in a famous paper published in 1954.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0072en" id="en0072"><sup>59</sup></a> Suppose jobs in the city pay $100 a week. In the village there are no jobs, but if you work on the family farm then you get your share of the farm income, which is $500 a week, but there are four of you, so each makes $125 a week. If you go, your brothers won’t share with you. Why would you go, especially if the hours are <a id="page-36"/>the same and the work is equally unpleasant? Lewis’s insight was that this argument stands whether or not you are needed on the farm. Suppose the output on the farm would be the same $500 whether or not you worked there, but you could add $100 to the family’s total kitty by going off to the city. You won’t do it because it does not help you; you will end up with your $100 and your three brothers will get to share the farm’s $500. Of course, today it may not be a farm; a family taxi business would be just as likely to keep you at home.</p>
<p>What Lewis was pointing out is that everyone in the family would be better off if, for example, they could promise you $50 from the farm for being away, so that your total take is $150, and your three brothers can each enjoy $150 as well. But maybe they cannot; maybe such promises are easily forgotten. Once you are gone, maybe they will deny you were ever part of the family business. So you stay on to enforce your claim. And as a result, Lewis thought, the speed of integration of the rural workforce into the more productive urban sector, be it domestically or abroad, will be too slow. There is too little migration in Lewis’s scenario.</p>
<p>The more general point here is that network connections, of which the family is a specific example, are designed to solve specific problems, but it does not mean they promote the general social good. It turns out, for example, that parents who worry about being abandoned in old age may strategically underinvest in the education of their children to make sure they do not have the option of moving to the city. In the state of Haryana, not too far from Delhi, researchers teamed up with firms recruiting for back-office processing jobs to provide information about these opportunities to villagers.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0073en" id="en0073"><sup>60</sup></a> The jobs required two things: moving to the city and a high school education. For girls, the parental response to the advertising campaigns was unambiguously beneficial; compared to girls in villages that did not get the information campaign, girls in campaign villages were better educated, married later, and perhaps, more remarkably, were better fed and taller.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0074en" id="en0074"><sup>61</sup></a> For boys, however, there was no increase in education on average; boys expected to leave the village to earn money benefitted from the intervention, much like the girls, but boys whose parents wanted them to stay home and take care of them ended up getting <em>less</em> education. The parents, in effect, chose to handicap their sons to keep them at home.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a013"><a id="page-37"/>SLEEPLESS IN KATHMANDU</h1>
<p class="noindent">In the experiment where villagers were offered $11.50 to go and explore the job market in one of the big cities of Bangladesh, many participants ended up so much better off that they should have been happy to pay out of pocket to get the opportunity.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0075en" id="en0075"><sup>62</sup></a> However, there were still a few who would have ended up worse off if they’d had to pay for the trip themselves: the ones who did not find a job and went back empty handed. Most people do not like risk, and those close to subsistence level especially so, since any loss could push them into starvation. Is that why so many people prefer not to try?</p>
<p>The problem with this explanation is that another option for potential migrants would be to save up $11.50 before making the trip. Then if they failed to find a job they could go home, and they would be no worse off than if they had not saved and not tried, which is what most of them seem to do. Moreover, the evidence suggests they do save for other things, and $11.50 is very much within their range. So why don’t they? One possible reason is they overestimate the risks. A study from Nepal highlights this.</p>
<p>Today, more than a fifth of Nepal’s male working-age population has been abroad at least once, mostly for work. Most of them work in Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or the United Arab Emirates. They typically go for a couple of years, with an employment contract tied to a specific employer.</p>
<p>This is a setting where one might imagine the migrants would be very well informed about the potential costs and benefits of migrating, since one needs a job offer to get a visa. Yet the Nepalese government officials we met expressed concerns the migrants did not know what they were getting into. They had inflated expectations about earnings, the officials told us, and had no idea how bad living conditions could be abroad. Maheshwor Shrestha, a Nepalese PhD student of ours, decided to investigate whether these officials were right.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0076en" id="en0076"><sup>63</sup></a> He placed himself with a small team in the passport office in Kathmandu, where potential migrants went to apply for their passports. He interviewed more than three thousand of these workers, asking them detailed questions about what they thought they would be paid, where they were going, and what they thought of the living conditions abroad.</p>
<p><a id="page-38"/>Maheshwor found these would-be migrants were in fact somewhat overoptimistic about their earnings prospects. Specifically, they overestimated their earning potential by around 25 percent, which could be for any number of reasons, including the possibility that the recruiters who provide job offers lied to them. But the really big mistake they made was that they vastly overestimated the chance of dying while they were abroad. A typical candidate for migration thought that out of a thousand migrants, over a two-year stint, about ten would come back in a box. The reality is just 1.3.</p>
<p>Maheshwor then gave some of the potential Nepali migrants information about the true wage rate or the actual risk of dying (or both). Comparing the migration decisions of those he informed that of to those he did not (just because his random procedure did not pick them), he found strong evidence the information was useful. Those provided information on wages lowered their expectations, while those provided information about mortality revised their estimates downward as well. Moreover, they acted on what they had learned; when he checked on them several weeks later, those who received the wage information were more likely to be still in Nepal. Those provided with information on mortality, on the other hand, were more likely to have left. Moreover, because the extent of misinformation about mortality was so much more severe than the misinformation about wages, those who got both pieces of information were more likely to have gone. Therefore, on average, contrary to what the Nepalese government believed, misinformation was keeping the migrants home.</p>
<p>Why did people systematically overestimate the risk of dying? Maheshwor offers an answer, showing that a single death of someone from a particular district (a small area) in Nepal significantly reduces migration flows from that district to the country where the death happened.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0077en" id="en0077"><sup>64</sup></a> Clearly, potential migrants pay attention to local information. The problem seems to be that when the media reports deaths from a particular region, it does not simultaneously report the number of migrant workers from that region. So the workers have no idea of whether it was one death out of a hundred or a thousand, and in the absence of this information, they tend to overreact.</p>
<p><a id="page-39"/>If people don’t have the right information in Nepal, with its many employment agencies, vast flows of workers in and out, and a government genuinely concerned about the welfare of its international migrants, one can only guess at how confused most potential migrants are elsewhere. Confusion could of course go either way, dampening migration, like in Nepal, or boosting it if people are overoptimistic. Why then is there a systematic bias against going?</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a014">RISK VERSUS UNCERTAINTY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Perhaps the exaggerated sense of mortality Maheshwor’s respondents reported should be read as a metaphor for a general sense of foreboding. Migration, after all, is leaving the familiar to embrace the unknown, and the unknown is more than just a list of different potential outcomes with associated probabilities, as economists would like to describe it. In fact, there is a long tradition in economics, going back at least to Frank Knight, of distinguishing between quantifiable risk (50 percent probability this happens, 50 percent that happens) and the rest, what Donald Rumsfeld memorably called the “unknown unknowns,”<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0078en" id="en0078"><sup>65</sup></a> and Knightian economists call <em>uncertainty</em>.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0079en" id="en0079"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>Frank Knight was convinced humans react very differently to risk and uncertainty. Most people don’t like dealing with the unknown unknowns, and will go to great lengths to avoid making decisions in cases where they do not know the exact contours of the problem.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the would-be migrants in rural Bangladesh, the city (and of course any foreign country) is a morass of uncertainties. In addition to not knowing how the market will value their particular sets of skills, they also need to worry about where to find potential employers, whether they face competition for their services or exploitation at the hands of a single employer, the kinds of references they will need, how long it will take to find a job, how they will survive until then, where they will live, and so on. They have little or no experience to guide them; the probabilities have to be made up. It is therefore not surprising that many potential migrants tend to hesitate.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a015"><a id="page-40"/>THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Migration is a plunge into the unknown, which may make people particularly reluctant to undertake it, even if they could in principle save up to cover the various financial contingencies involved. It is uncertain rather than risky. Additionally, there is good evidence that people particularly hate mistakes of their own making. The world is fraught with uncertainties, many of which people have no control over. These vagaries make them unhappy, but perhaps not as unhappy as making an active choice that ends up, purely as a result of bad luck, making them worse off than if they had done nothing. The status quo, the outcome of letting things be, serves as a natural benchmark. Any loss relative to that benchmark is particularly painful. This concept was named <em>loss aversion</em> by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, two psychologists who have been incredibly influential in economics. (Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in economics in 2002 and Tversky would probably have as well, but for his untimely demise.)</p>
<p>Since their original work, a vast literature has demonstrated the existence of loss aversion and its ability to explain many apparently strange behaviors. For example, most people pay a huge premium on their home insurance plans to get a low deductible.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0080en" id="en0080"><sup>67</sup></a> This allows them to avoid that painful moment when, after some accident has damaged their house, they have to pay a large sum out of pocket (the high deductible). By comparison, the fact that they may be paying a lot extra now (to get the policy with the low deductible) is painless because they will never discover if it was a mistake. The same logic also explains why gullible buyers often end up with outrageously expensive “extended warranties.” In essence, loss aversion makes us extremely worried about any risk, even small, that is a consequence of our active choice. Migration, unless everyone else is doing it, is one of these active choices, and a big one; it is easy to imagine many will be chary of trying.</p>
<p>Finally, failure in migration is something people take personally. They have heard too many success stories, admiringly told, to not feel that failure would reveal something about them to themselves, if not to the world. In 1952, Esther’s grandfather, Albert Granjon, a veterinarian running a slaughterhouse in Le Mans, France, took his wife and four young children to Argentina, then a journey of several weeks <a id="page-41"/>by boat. He was inspired by a desire for adventure, and had the somewhat vague plan of forming a partnership for raising cattle with some acquaintances. That plan collapsed less than a year after the family’s arrival. The conditions on the farm were harder than he had thought and he fought with his business partners, who complained he had not brought enough money to fund the venture. The young family found itself in the middle of nowhere in a country they did not know, with no income. Returning to France would have been relatively easy at that point. In the booming postwar years, Esther’s grandfather could have easily found a job. He had two solidly middle-class brothers who could have paid for the return voyage. But he chose not to. His wife, Evelynne, told Esther many years later that coming back empty handed, having begged his brothers for the price of the passage, was an unacceptable loss of face. So the family toughed it out, living for over two years in dire poverty, made worse by a misplaced sense of superiority vis-à-vis the natives. The children were not allowed to speak Spanish at home. Violaine, Esther’s mother, completed her entire schooling through a French correspondence course—she never went to school in Argentina—and spent her spare time doing chores, fixing holes in the cloth sandals the children wore. The family’s financial situation improved only when Albert finally got a job running an experimental farm for Institut Mérieux, a French pharmaceutical company. They would stay in Argentina for over ten years before going on to Peru, Colombia, and Senegal. Albert went back to France after his health deteriorated (though he was still quite young), but by then his career trajectory could plausibly be described as a successful adventure. Still, the hardscrabble life surely had taken a toll, and he died shortly after his return.</p>
<p>The fear of failure is a substantial disincentive for embarking on a risky adventure. Many people prefer not to try. After all, most of us want to protect an image of ourselves as intelligent, hard-working, morally upright individuals, both because it is simply not pleasant to admit we might in fact be dumb, lazy, and unscrupulous, but also because maintaining a good opinion of ourselves preserves our motivation to keep trying in the face of whatever life throws at us.</p>
<p>And if it is important to hold on to a certain self-image, then it also makes sense to burnish it. We do this actively by filtering out negative <a id="page-42"/>information. Another option is to simply avoid taking actions that have at least some chance of rebounding badly on us. If I cross the road to avoid passing by a beggar, I won’t have to reveal to myself that I lack generosity. A good student may fail to study for an exam in order to have a ready-made excuse that will preserve his perception of being intelligent, should he not do well. A would-be migrant who stays home can always maintain the fiction he would have succeeded had he gone.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0081en" id="en0081"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>It takes an ability to dream (Albert, Esther’s grandfather, was seeking adventure rather than escaping from a bad situation), or a substantial dose of overconfidence, to overcome this tendency to persist with the status quo. This is perhaps why migrants, at least those not pushed out by desperation, tend to be not the richest or the most educated, but those who have some special drive, which is why we find so many successful entrepreneurs among them.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a016">AFTER TOCQUEVILLE</h1>
<p class="noindent">Americans are supposed to be the exception to this rule. Most of them are willing to take risks and move toward opportunity, or at least that has always been the myth. Alexis de Tocqueville was a nineteenth-century French aristocrat who saw America as a model of what a free society could be. For him, restlessness was one of the things that made America special: people moved all the time, both across sectors and across occupations. Tocqueville attributed this restlessness to the combination of a lack of hereditary class structure and a constant desire to accumulate.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0082en" id="en0082"><sup>69</sup></a> Everyone had a shot at striking it rich, and therefore it was their responsibility to follow the opportunities wherever they might be.</p>
<p>Americans still believe in this American dream, though as a point of fact, heredity plays a <em>greater</em> role in the fortunes of today’s Americans than it does in Europe.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0083en" id="en0083"><sup>70</sup></a> And that may have something to do with America’s declining restlessness. For at the same time as they were becoming less tolerant of international migration, Americans became less mobile themselves. In the 1950s, 7 percent of the population used to move to another county every year. Fewer than 4 percent did in <a id="page-43"/>2018. The decline started in 1990 and accelerated in the mid-2000s.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0084en" id="en0084"><sup>71</sup></a> Furthermore, there is a striking change in the pattern of internal migration.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0085en" id="en0085"><sup>72</sup></a> Until the mid-1980s, rich states in the US had much faster population-growth rates. Sometime after 1990, this relation disappeared; on average, rich states no longer attract more people. High-skilled workers continue to move from poor states to rich states, but now low-skilled workers, to the extent they still move, seem to be moving in the opposite direction. These two trends mean that since the 1990s, the US labor market has become increasingly segregated by skill level. The coasts attract more and more educated workers, while the less well educated seem to concentrate inland, particularly in the old industrial cities in the east like Detroit, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. This has contributed to the divergence in earnings, lifestyles, and voting patterns in the country and a sense of dislocation, with some regions left behind as others pull ahead.</p>
<p>The pull of Palo Alto, California, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, for highly educated software or biotech workers is not surprising. Wages are higher for educated workers in those cities, and they are more likely to find friends and the amenities they enjoy.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0086en" id="en0086"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<p>But why don’t less-well-educated workers follow them? After all, lawyers need gardeners, cooks, and baristas. The concentration of educated workers should create a demand for uneducated workers and encourage them to move. And this is the United States where, unlike in Bangladesh, almost everyone can afford the bus fare across the state, or even across the country. The information is much better and everyone knows where the boomtowns are.</p>
<p>Part of the answer is that the wage gain from being in a booming city is lower for workers with only a high school degree than for high-skilled workers.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0087en" id="en0087"><sup>74</sup></a> But this can only be a part of the reason. There is a wage premium for low-skilled workers too. According to websites that post salaries online, a Starbucks barista makes about $12 an hour in Boston and $9 in Boise.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0088en" id="en0088"><sup>75</sup></a> This is less than the gains for high-skilled workers, but still not negligible (and, in addition, in Boston they get to have an attitude).</p>
<p>However, precisely because there is such demand from the growing numbers of high-skilled workers, housing costs have exploded in Palo <a id="page-44"/>Alto and Cambridge and other similar places. A lawyer and a janitor would both earn much more in New York than in the Deep South, although the difference between the wages in New York and in the Deep South would be higher for the lawyer (45 percent) than for the janitor (32 percent). But housing costs are only 21 percent of a lawyer’s wages in New York, while they are 52 percent of a janitor’s. As a result, the real wage after subtracting the cost of living is indeed much higher for the lawyer in New York than in the Deep South (37 percent), but the opposite is true for the janitor (he would make 6 percent more in the Deep South). It makes no sense for a janitor to move to New York.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0089en" id="en0089"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>The Mission District in San Francisco has become a symbol of this phenomenon. Until the late 1990s, the Mission District was a working-class neighborhood dominated by recent Hispanic immigrants, but its location made it attractive to the young workers of the tech industry. Average rents for one-bedroom apartments have been going up steeply, from $1,900 in 2011 to $2,675 in 2013 and $3,250 in 2014.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0090en" id="en0090"><sup>77</sup></a> Today, the average rent of an apartment in the Mission District puts it entirely out of reach for someone earning minimum wage.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0091en" id="en0091"><sup>78</sup></a> The “Mission yuppie eradication project,” a last-ditch effort to drive tech workers away by vandalizing their cars, drew considerable attention to the gentrification of the Mission District, but ultimately was doomed.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0092en" id="en0092"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p>Of course, more houses can be built near booming cities, but it takes time. Moreover, many of the older cities in the United States have zoning regulations designed to make it hard to build up or build densely. Buildings cannot be very different from what exists, property lots have to be a minimum size, and so on. This makes it harder to transition to high-density neighborhoods when housing demand goes up. As in the developing world, this presents the new migrant with a rather dire set of choices: live far away from work or pay through the nose.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0093en" id="en0093"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>Recent growth in the United States has been concentrated in locations with strong educational institutions. These places also tend to be the older cities with expensive and hard-to-expand stocks of real estate. Many are also more “European” cities, which tend to have stronger incentives to preserve their historical endowment against the <a id="page-45"/>forces of development, and hence have restrictive zoning regulations and high rents. This might be one reason why the average American is not moving to where the growth is happening.</p>
<p>If a worker loses his job because his region is hit by an economic downturn, and he contemplates moving to get a job elsewhere, the real estate question gets even more complicated. As long as he has his house, even if its resale value may be very low, at least he can live in it. If he doesn’t own the house, it is still true that he will benefit more from the fall in rents resulting from the meltdown in the local economy than a high-skilled worker, since housing is a larger part of his budget.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0094en" id="en0094"><sup>81</sup></a> The collapse of the local housing market that typically accompanies a downturn therefore tends to, perversely, keep the poor from going other places.</p>
<p>There are other reasons to stay put even if opportunities are scarce at home and better elsewhere; childcare, for one, is expensive in the United States, due to a combination of strict regulations and lack of public subsidies. For someone with a low-wage job, buying childcare at market price is often out of the question; the only recourse is grandparents or, failing that, other relatives or friends. And unless you can get them to come with you, moving is out of the question. This was less of an issue when most women did not work and could provide the childcare, but in today’s world it can be a clincher.</p>
<p>Moreover, the job may not last. Job loss leads to eviction, and then it is hard to get another job if you don’t have an address.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0095en" id="en0095"><sup>82</sup></a> In such times, family also provides a safety net, both financial and emotional; unemployed young people move back to their parents’ house. Among unemployed men in their prime working age, 67 percent live with their parents or a close relative (up from about 46 percent in 2000).<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0096en" id="en0096"><sup>83</sup></a> It is easy to understand why one might be reluctant to leave that comfort and security behind and move to a different city.</p>
<p>For people who just lost a job in, say, manufacturing after spending most of their career working in their hometown for a single employer, all this is compounded by the trauma of having to start over again. Instead of going from comfortable employment to graceful retirement as many of their fathers did, they are being asked to reset their expectations, move to a town where no one knows them, and start at the <a id="page-46"/>bottom of the ladder in a job they never imagined they would have to do. No wonder they’d rather stay put.</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a017">THE COMEBACK CITIES TOUR</h1>
<p class="noindent">If it is hard for people to move from distressed areas, why aren’t jobs coming to them? Surely firms could take advantage of the newly available labor force, lower wages, and lower rents in the counties where other firms have closed. This idea has been floated. In December 2017, Steven Case, the billionaire co-founder of AOL, and J. D. Vance, the author of <em>Hillbilly Elegy,</em> a lament for America’s lost heartland, started the investment fund Rise of the Rest. It was funded by some of the best-known billionaires in America (from Jeff Bezos to Eric Schmidt), to invest in states traditionally overlooked by tech investors. A bus tour (the Comeback Cities Tour) took a group of Silicon Valley investors to places like Youngstown and Akron, Ohio; Detroit and Flint, Michigan; and South Bend, Indiana. The fund promoters were quick to point out this was not a social impact fund, but a traditional money-making venture. In the <em>New York Times</em>, when reporting on the trip<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0097en" id="en0097"><sup>84</sup></a> and the fund itself,<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0098en" id="en0098"><sup>85</sup></a> many Silicon Valley investors emphasized the congestion, the insularity, the high cost of living in the Bay Area, and the great opportunities in the “heartland.”</p>
<p>But for all the chatter, there were reasons to be skeptical. The size of the fund was only $150 million—pocket money for people in this group. Bezos backed the venture, but not enough to put Detroit on the shortlist of possible headquarters for Amazon’s HQ2. The hope clearly was to create some excitement, to get some enterprise started, and to start some buzz around the early investors to encourage others. It worked for Harlem, so why not for Akron? Except that Harlem is in land-scarce Manhattan, with all its excitement and its many amenities. The Harlem revival was bound to happen one day. We are less optimistic about Akron (or South Bend or Detroit). It is difficult for those places to provide the kinds of alluring amenities most young affluent people look for these days: nice restaurants, glitzy bars, and cafes where they can buy overpriced espressos from high-minded baristas. In other words, there is a chicken and egg problem: young educated <a id="page-47"/>workers will not come unless these amenities exist, but the amenities cannot thrive unless there are enough workers like them around.</p>
<p>In fact, firms in almost every industry tend to be clustered. Suppose you threw darts at random on a map of the United States. You’d find the holes left by the darts to be more or less evenly distributed across the map. But the real map of any given industry looks nothing like that; it looks more as if someone had thrown all the darts in the same place.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0099en" id="en0099"><sup>86</sup></a> This is probably in part because of reputation; buyers may be suspicious of a software firm in the middle of the cornfields. It would also be hard to recruit workers if every time you needed a new employee you had to persuade someone to move across the country, rather than just poach one from your neighbor. There are also regulatory reasons: zoning laws often try to concentrate dirty industries in one place, and restaurants and bars in another. Finally, people in the same industry often have similar preferences (techies like coffee, financiers show off with expensive bottles of wine). Concentration makes it easier to provide the amenities they like.</p>
<p>Clustering, for all these reasons, makes sense, but it means it is that much harder to start small and grow. Being the one biotech firm in Appalachia is always going to be hard. We hope the Comeback Cities Tour succeeds, but we are not holding our breath (or buying real estate in Detroit).</p>
<h1 class="sect1" id="a018">EISENHOWER AND STALIN</h1>
<p class="noindent">The real migration crisis is not that there is too much international migration. Most of the time, migration comes at no economic cost to the native population, and it delivers some clear benefits to the migrants. The real problem is that people are often unable or unwilling to move, within and outside their country of birth, to take advantage of economic opportunities. Does that suggest that a forward-looking government should reward people who move and perhaps even penalize those who refuse to?</p>
<p>This might sound outlandish, given that the current conversation is mostly focused on how to limit migration, but in the 1950s the governments of the United States, Canada, China, South Africa, and the <a id="page-48"/>Soviet Union were all heavily involved in more or less forced relocation policies. Those policies often had unstated but brutal political goals (suppression of troublesome ethnic groups being one), but they tended to be cloaked in the language of modernization, which emphasized the economic deficiencies of traditional economic arrangements. The modernization agenda in developing countries has often taken inspiration from these examples.</p>
<p>There is also a long tradition in developing countries of governments using price and tax policies to benefit the urban sector at the cost of the rural. Many countries in Africa in the 1970s created what they called agricultural marketing boards. This was a cruel joke, since many of the boards were intended to <em>prevent</em> the marketing of produce so the board could buy it at the lowest prices, thereby stabilizing prices for city dwellers. Other countries, like India and China, banned exports of farm products to keep prices where urban consumers wanted them. A by-product of these policies was to make agriculture unprofitable, encouraging people to leave their farms. Of course, these policies hurt the poorest people in the economy, the small farmers and the landless laborers, who may not have had the wherewithal to move.</p>
<p>This unfortunate history should not, however, blind us to the economic rationale for promoting migration. Mobility (internal and international) is a key channel through which standards of living can even out across regions and countries, and regional economic ups and downs can be absorbed. If workers move, they will take advantage of new opportunities and leave regions hit by economic adversity. This is how an economy can absorb crises and adapt to structural transformation.</p>
<p>For those of us (including most economists) who already live in the richer countries and the most successful cities, it seems so obvious that we have it so much better where we are that we assume everyone else would want to come. For economists, the economic magnetism of successful places is largely a good thing. For city dwellers in developing countries or the residents of rich countries, on the other hand, the assumption that the whole world will be drawn to their areas is a scary prospect. They imagine masses of people coming and fighting them for the scarce resources they have, from jobs to spots in public housing to parking spaces. That central concern, that migrants lower <a id="page-49"/>wages and employment prospects for natives, is misplaced, but the fear of overcrowding, especially in the half-built cities of the third world, is not entirely unwarranted.</p>
<p>The fear of being overwhelmed is also what gives rise to worries about assimilation. If too many people with a different culture come (from country cousins moving within India to Mexicans settling in the United States), will they assimilate or will they change the culture? Or, for that matter, will they assimilate so well that their culture will vanish, leaving us all with a uniform globalized tasteless blend? A utopia of perfect and instant movement in response to any difference in economic opportunities might become its own dystopia.</p>
<p>But we are nowhere near such a utopia/dystopia. Far from being irrepressibly attracted by economically successful places, people struggling where they are often prefer to stay home.</p>
<p>This suggests that encouraging migration, both internal and external, should indeed be a policy priority, but that the right way to do it should be not by forcing people or distorting economic incentives, as has been done in the past, but by removing some of the key obstacles.</p>
<p>Streamlining the whole process and communicating it more effectively, so workers have a much better understanding of the costs and rewards of migration, would help. Making it easier for migrants and their households to send money back and forth to each other would also help by making migrants less isolated. Given the outsized fear of failure, offering migrants some insurance against failure would be a possibility. When this was offered in Bangladesh, the effects were almost as large as the effect of offering a bus ticket.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0100en" id="en0100"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p>But the best way to help (and therefore perhaps encourage) migrants while making locals more accepting is probably to ease their integration. Offering housing assistance (rent subsidies?), pre-migration matching to a job, help with childcare arrangements, and so on would ensure that any newcomer quickly finds a place in society. This applies both to internal and international mobility. It would make those who hesitate more likely to make the trip and allow them to become more quickly a part of the normal existing fabric of the host communities. We are almost in the opposite situation now. With the exception of the work done by some organizations to help refugees, nothing is really done to make it easy for someone to adjust. International migrants face <a id="page-50"/>a real obstacle course to get the right to work legally. Internal migrants have no place to stay and often struggle to land their first job, even when there seem to be many opportunities.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot forget that the politics of the response to migration is not just one of misunderstood economics, but also one of identity politics. There is nothing new in the disconnect between economics and politics. US cities that received the most European migrants in the golden age of European migration benefited economically from them. But despite that, immigrants triggered widespread and hostile political reactions. Cities cut taxes and public spending in response to immigration. Within public spending, the cuts were particularly deep for services that made interethnic contact more likely (like schools) or those that helped low-income immigrants (such as sewerage, garbage collection, etc.). In cities that got the most migrants, the vote share of the Democratic Party, which supported immigration, declined and more conservative politicians, in particular those who supported the National Origins Act of 1924 (which put an end to the era of unrestricted immigration to the US) were elected. Voters were reacting to the cultural distance between them and the new migrants; at the time Catholics and Jews were considered irremediably alien, until of course they assimilated.<a epub:type="noteref" href="endnotes.xhtml#en0101en" id="en0101"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>The fact that history repeats itself does not make it less unpleasant the second or third time around. But perhaps it helps us understand better how to react to this anger. We will return to this question in <a href="chapter004.xhtml">chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we also need to remember that many people, regardless of any incentives on offer, will choose not to move. This immobility, which runs against every economist’s instinct of how people should behave, has profound implications for the entire economy. It affects the consequences of a wide range of economic policies, as we will see throughout this book. We will see in the next chapter, for example, that it partially explains why international trade has been much less beneficial than many hoped, and in <a href="chapter005.xhtml">chapter 5</a> we will discuss how it affects economic growth. This requires a rethinking of social policy that takes this immobility into account, something we will attempt in <a href="chapter009.xhtml">chapter 9</a>.</p>
