<p class="noindent">PublicAffairs is a publishing house founded in 1997. It is a tribute to the standards, values, and flair of three persons who have served as mentors to countless reporters, writers, editors, and book people of all kinds, including me.</p>
<p class="space-break">I.F. S<span class="small-caps">TONE</span>, proprietor of <em>I. F. Stone’s Weekly</em>, combined a commitment to the First Amendment with entrepreneurial zeal and reporting skill and became one of the great independent journalists in American history. At the age of eighty, Izzy published <em>The Trial of Socrates,</em> which was a national bestseller. He wrote the book after he taught himself ancient Greek.</p>
<p class="space-break">B<span class="small-caps">ENJAMIN</span> C. B<span class="small-caps">RADLEE</span> was for nearly thirty years the charismatic editorial leader of <em>The Washington Post.</em> It was Ben who gave the <em>Post</em> the range and courage to pursue such historic issues as Watergate. He supported his reporters with a tenacity that made them fearless and it is no accident that so many became authors of influential, best-selling books.</p>
<p class="space-break">R<span class="small-caps">OBERT</span> L. B<span class="small-caps">ERNSTEIN</span>, the chief executive of Random House for more than a quarter century, guided one of the nation’s premier publishing houses. Bob was personally responsible for many books of political dissent and argument that challenged tyranny around the globe. He is also the founder and longtime chair of Human Rights Watch, one of the most respected human rights organizations in the world.</p>

<p class="space-break">For fifty years, the banner of Public Affairs Press was carried by its owner Morris B. Schnapper, who published Gandhi, Nasser, Toynbee, Truman, and about 1,500 other authors. In 1983, Schnapper was described by <em>The Washington Post</em> as “a redoubtable gadfly.” His legacy will endure in the books to come.</p>
