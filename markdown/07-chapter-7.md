### Chapter 7
# 'Old' is Gold


The tiny state of Goa on the western coast of India is divided into
three geographical divisions: the coastland, the midland, and the
hinterland. All three are equally beautiful, pristine, peaceful, and
soothing with their unique characteristics. The coastland primarily
consists of beaches and low-lying river basins strewn with coconut
plantations. The midland is made up of plateaus and small hillocks
planted with cashew, rivulets flowing in the valleys, some islands,
refreshing green paddy fields and other vegetation including *Kullagar*
(orchards of coconut, betel nut and all kinds of fruit-bearing
trees). The hinterland comprises mountainous regions of the Sahyadri
Ghats with thick forests, consisting of rich flora and fauna, boasting
a rich biodiversity, and replete with waterfalls.

The coastland, which was earlier predominantly dependent on fishing,
toddy tapping and some agriculture, is now the economic hotspot of Goa
due to tourism. The hinterland, where cashew plantation, shifting
cultivation and terrace farming were the primary economic activities,
has been hijacked by the mining industry operating open-pit mines for
manganese and iron ore, and laterite and other stone quarries,
effectively bulldozing its agricultural economy. Though industrial
estates have come up on the plateaus, the midland, however, is still
dominated by agriculture and horticulture. The politics of economics,
accordingly, differs in all these three ‘lands’.

With agriculture coming to a grinding halt in the hinterland, tourism
booming in the coastland, and manufacturing as well as the services
sector growing slowly in the midland, urbanisation has increased in
leaps and bounds in the last four to five decades.  More in number
than municipal towns are the census towns, which are spread in the
villages, especially of the coastal belt.  In fact, the entire coastal
stretch from Pernem to Canacona is now urbanised. The locals tend to
blame migrants from outside Goa for this trend, but in reality there
are more locals who have migrated to the towns than the Bhaile
(outsiders).

In 1960, Goa was 85 per cent rural and only 15 per cent urban. Today,
it is 62 per cent urban and only 38 per cent rural.  This is the
opposite of the rest of India: 35 per cent urban and 65 per cent
rural. In the last 50 years (till the 2011 Census), the urban
population has increased by 8.19 lakhs. The migrants from other states
among these would not exceed 3.5 lakhs, or at the most four
lakhs. This means that the same number of Goans (or more) have either
shifted their base from the village to a city managed by a
municipality, or that the village itself has turned into a small
township administered by a village panchayat. In addition, there are
new townships like Porvorim that come under several panchayats. This
has not only impacted the socioeconomic structure of Goa, but also the
politics of land.

## Old Conquests Rule Goa

Old and New Conquests are not merely historical terms, or geographical
territories. They are more significant today politically. The Old
Conquests form one-fifth of Goa’s geographical spread, consisting of
only four talukas − Bardez, Tiswadi, Mormugao, and Salcete. But they
include the port town of Vasco, the commercial towns of Mapusa and
Margao, and the capital city of Panaji. In addition, Goa’s prime
tourist belt is spread out in the Old Conquests. In contrast, in the
New Conquests it is only Pernem and Canacona talukas that have some
beaches, and do not have tourism spread into the interior
villages. The Old Conquests are thus thickly populated, and their
population is swelling by the day.

Goa has a total of 40 Assembly constituencies. Out of these, the Old
Conquests comprise 24 constituencies, more than half of this total −
four in Mormugao, five in Tiswadi, seven in Bardez and eight in
Salcete. Even during the time when Goa was a Union Territory, when six
Assemblies were constituted from 1963 to 1984 out of 28
constituencies, the Old Conquests had 16 constituencies, again more
than half. And historically, we know that the Old Conquests were
dominated by Christians, since no significant religious conversions
took place in the New Conquests.

Until the 2007 Assembly election, the Old Conquests had 22
constituencies. However, after delimitation, from the 2009 Lok Sabha
elections, Porvorim was added to Bardez taluka and Dabolim was added
to Mormugao taluka. On the other hand, in the New Conquests, Dhargalim
in Pernem taluka and Poinguinim in Canacona taluka were dropped as
Assembly segments. Also, old components of the other Assembly segments
were exchanged, with additions and deletions. The whole exercise was
conducted in response to the increasing or decreasing number of
voters, as a result of in-migration from other states and local
migration of Goans to urban areas.

It is therefore important to understand these trends of urbanisation
that are leading to the Old Conquests becoming politically and
economically dominant day by day. It is equally important to analyse
the influence of the minority Christian community, which is
concentrated in the Old Conquests. Are they losing their political
hegemony in Goa’s politics? Is that the reason for the inhabitants of
the Old Conquests to be up in arms against the housing projects coming
up in their areas? Has Goa’s politics started moving around land with
a demographic perspective?

## Goans - Not Migrants - Congesting The Cities!

In 1977, the veteran freedom fighter Madhav Bir was elected as the
Panaji MLA to the fifth assembly. During an assembly debate on
Housing, he demanded that the newly formed Goa Housing Board (1969)
should start developing the plateau of Alto-Betim, through which
passed a road going to Mapusa from Panaji via the Mandovi bridge which
was built in 1971. It was then an open space except for a few
prominent bungalows, like the one owned by the then chief minister,
Shashikala Kakodkar.

With Panaji seeing rapid development as the capital of Goa, pressure
for housing had started mounting. Taking up the suggestion made by
Bir, a new Housing Board colony came up there, followed by other
colonies, such as the Journalists’ Colony, Defence Colony, etc. The
‘development’ of the plateau got a boost, and within four decades
Porvorim became the largest township of Goa with a population of over
60,000 in a small area of 8.12 square kilometres.[^1] Since 2009, it
has been a separate assembly constituency with over 25,000 voters.

[^1]: Wikipedia; Porvorim

The Mandovi bridge collapsed in 1986, and within two years a second
bridge was built. Later, the old bridge was repaired and returned into
operation as a parallel bridge. In 2019, to regulate the heavy volume
of traffic from Porvorim, as well as the other townships of Bardez
taluka, a third bridge, the Atal Setu, has been built above the
existing two bridges.

Porvorim once used to be a plateau that served as a grazing pasture
for cattle. It was, in fact, a small vaddo of the Socorro village,
down the plateau, at the crossroads where the Panaji- Mapusa national
highway cuts through the road from Socorro to Sangolda. People living
on the Porvorim plateau don’t even know that the name belonged to a
small marketplace (tintto) on the crossroads down the hill. The
politics of this township and the constituency revolves around land,
and only the land. This plateau is shared between the six village
panchayats of Socorro, Salvador de Mundo, Penha da Franca, Reis Magos,
Pilerne and Sangolda. And more importantly, the land is owned by four
Communidades of Serula, Pilerne, Sangolda, and Nerul. It is
exclusively used for housing.

During his first tenure as the chief minister, Manohar Parrikar had
proposed to incorporate this whole township, as well as the extended
city of Panaji in Taleigao panchayat into the Panaji municipality, for
which he had constituted Goa’s first municipal corporation, the City
Corporation of Panaji (CCP). But Parrikar had to surrender to the
mighty power of landpoliticians who dominated the local panchayats and
the plan was shelved. Today, the CCP is a corporation only in name,
while Porvorim continues to be administered by the six panchayats and
the three Communidades. Hardly any person living on this plateau
belongs to these villages. They are either Goans who have migrated
from other villages, from Pernem to Canacona, or wealthy migrants from
other states. The government has also shifted the Secretariat, the
Assembly, and even the High Court to Porvorim, along with some other
establishments.

Porvorim is not the only township of Goa. Panaji itself has expanded
to Taleigao, Bambolim, Merces, Chimbel, Kadamba Plateau of Bainguinim,
right up to Old Goa. Other towns in the Old Conquests are no
exception. The port town of Vasco has expanded to cover almost all the
hillocks around it, such as Sada, New Vaddem, Driver Hill, Uttor
Dongor, Chichalim, Dabolim, as well as the plateau of Zuarinagar;
Margao now includes Vidyanagar (Housing Board colony), Fatorda,
Navelim, and Davorlim; and Mapusa covers Khorlim, Ganeshpuri, Duler,
etc, making them thickly populated extended towns of Goa.

The biggest new settlement in the New Conquests is found in Ponda city
that has expanded to Shantinagar, Curti, Bethora, up to Borim and
Usgao. Besides this, a central vaddo like Marcela of Tivrem-Vargao
panchayat, Housing Board Colonies of Sankhli, as well as Bicholim, and
several other places have developed into small or large townships
settled by urbanised middle and upper-class Goans. Compared to other
states, Goa has very few slum areas: Baina and Zuarinagar of Vasco;
Moti Dongor of Margao; Indiranagar of Chimbel; Ganganagar and Ekta
Nagar of Mapusa, etc.

The Census of India defines a town as:

1. All places with a municipality, corporation, cantonment board or
notified town area committee etc.
2. All other places which satisfy the following criteria:
   - a minimum population of 5000;
   - at least 75 per cent of the male working population engaged in
     non-agricultural pursuits; and
   - a density of population of at least 400 per sq. km.[^2] 
	
Based on these criteria, Goa had only five towns in 1950, to which six
were added after liberation in 1961. In spite of urbanisation and an
influx of migrants into city areas, by 1981, the number of towns had
increased from 11 to 15, including the municipal towns. But the number
doubled to 31 by 1991. By 2001 Goa had 44 towns and the figure reached
70 in 2011. This includes 14 municipalities and 56 other
townships. Now, the urban agglomerations are not limited to suburbs of
municipal towns, but cover practically the entire coastal belt, from
Pernem in the north to Canacona in the south. The majority of these
fall in the Old Conquests. For all practical purposes, the Goa of
today is a City State!

[^2]: Census of India

Following a state-wide agitation against the conspiracy of Goa’s
politicians to concretise large parts of the state, the destructive
Regional Plan of Goa was finally scrapped in 2006.  But the struggle
continues even today. The focus has shifted to mega housing projects
that are coming up in the coastal villages of the Old Conquests
without first building the required infrastructure to support them. A
prime example is the mega housing project of the Rahejas proposed in
the sleepy village of Carmona in Salcete. The Rahejas had planned for
constructing 750 dwellings in an area of 80,000 square metres, adding
not less than two to three thousand people to the village population
of just four thousand, living in about a thousand houses. The project,
meant for people from outside Goa, was finally scrapped in spite of
the support of local politicians. The urbanisation of Goa however
continues unabated.

The villages of Goa are shrinking as it slowly turns into a City
State. The graph clearly shows that the rate of population growth in
rural parts of Goa is not only declining but has reached a negative
mode for the last three decades. From minus two per cent in 2001, it
has declined dramatically to minus eighteen per cent in just ten
years. That’s alarming. The figures of 2021 are yet to be released.

What it means in terms of number is that though Goa had a population
of five lakhs living in its villages in 1960, in 2011, despite
population growth it has reached only 5.51 lakhs. That’s a negligible
increase of 10 per cent over 50 years. This is because either most
villagers have migrated to the cities, or their villages have been
converted into urban agglomerations. In contrast, the towns of Goa had
a marginal population of 87,000 at the time of liberation. Today, it
has zoomed to nine lakhs. A growth of 934 per cent in five decades!

## The Christian Factor In The Old Conquests

Since people from the New Conquests are migrating to the Old
Conquests, it stands to reason that the numbers will be dominated by
Hindus. This does not mean that Christians from the New Conquests are
not migrating. For employment opportunities and better educational
prospects, many Christians from the New Conquests prefer buying a flat
in a city, rather than buying land in the village and building a
house. Overall, the Hindu population is rising constantly in the Old
Conquests and declining in the New Conquests.

However, this does not imply that Christians are a minority as far as
Goa’s electoral politics is concerned. Rather, in some of the
constituencies of the Old Conquests, it’s a brutal majority.  Unlike
in the ‘60s and ‘70s, many village-based constituencies of the Old
Conquests have been swelling with urbanised Goans and migrants from
outside Goa. Most of them are non- Christians. But this does not
affect the Christian domination in their constituencies. The table is
a testimony.

When Goa went for its first poll in 1963, the Christians constituted
nearly 60 per cent of the electorate in the then 16 constituencies of
the Old Conquests. Since then, the number of constituencies has risen
to 24, new townships have come up, people from outside Goa and from
the New Conquests have migrated in, but still nearly half of the
population remains Christian. The Hindu population, in the last 50
years, has increased marginally, from 40 to 47 per cent. And the rise
in the Muslim population is still at a single digit, from one to five
per cent.

In terms of talukas, Bardez always had Hindu-majority constituencies,
such as Mapusa, Siolim and Tivim. They always remained bastions of the
Maharashtra Gomantak Party (MGP).  In 1977, the MGP had won even the
Calangute seat. Their Christian MLA, Raul Fernandes, was the education
minister in Shashikala Kakodkar’s government.

The Christian population of Tiswadi has also reduced drastically in
the last five decades, from 45 to 28 per cent.  Even one-time
Christian-majority constituencies, such as St Cruz and St Andre are
dominated by the Hindus today. But, except for Shripad Kunkalienkar,
who won the seat twice in 1977 and 1984 on a Congress ticket, and
Vishnu Wagh who took the seat in 2012 on a BJP ticket, St Andre has
always elected a Christian candidate. Dr Jack de Sequeira, known in
Goan politics as the leader of the Christian community, was elected
from St Cruz three times, from 1967 to 1977 on UGP and Janata Party
tickets. Till today, St Cruz has not elected a Hindu MLA.

Cortalim is the only constituency in Mormugao which was dominated by
Christians right from the beginning, having always had Christian
MLAs. In spite of the influx of migrant outsiders and local Goans,
other constituencies in and around the port town of Vasco were also
held by Christian candidates several times. Momugao was in fact a
Hindu-majority constituency right from the beginning and yet held by
Christian legislators.  Prominent among them are Urminda Lima Leitao
(UGP) in 1963, John Manuel Vaz (Independent) in 1994, and his son Karl Vaz
(Congress) in 2002.

Even after continuous migrations, and new townships coming up every
five years, Salcete is still held by the Christian community. It has
eight constituencies. The whole picture of election results in Goa
changes when counting begins in Salcete. During the Union Territory
days when it had five constituencies, only Margao was consistently
held by a Hindu, like Vasudev Sarmalkar and Anant alias Babu Naik till
he was defeated by Adv Uday Behmbre in a historic election held
in 1984. All three of them were in total harmony with the
Christians. The rest of the four constituencies till 1984 and seven
seats till date have always been held by Christian MLAs.

The only exception is Fatorda, which came into existence as an
assembly seat in 1989. Luis Alex alias Mama Cardoz, a tribal leader,
won the seat thrice, from 1989 to 1999, and lost it to BJP’s Damu Naik
in 2002 by a slim margin of just 588 votes, that too because Monte
Cruz (UGDP) split his Congress votes by polling around 4000 votes. But
Damu Naik could not hold on beyond two elections. Vijai Sardesai,
either as an Independent or as a candidate of the Goa Forward Party,
has been defeating the BJP candidate in Fatorda, with full support of
the Christian community. He is now in trouble for the 2022 poll
because the Christians are condemning him for joining hands with the
BJP government.

The Election Commission of India neither maintains its records on the
basis of religion, nor promotes elections on religious lines. A
similar spirit is shown by Goan voters, though political parties do
count the number of voters based on religion.  One such break-up,
though not fully authentic, was created by Vivek Mordekar, one of
Goa’s leading IT professionals, on the basis of surnames. This
provides a clear picture of how religion counts in Goan politics in
terms of choosing popular candidates, but does not matter when it
comes to voting.

Even after an in-migration in large numbers and the influx of local
Hindus (also a few Muslims), five constituencies in Salcete continue
to be dominated by Christians: Nuvem, Benaulim, Velim, Curtorim and
Cuncolim.

The second category shown in the table is of five constituencies where
the population of Hindu and Christian- Muslim minorities is almost
equal: Calangute, St Andre, Cortalim, Fatorda, and Navelim. These were
the Christianmajority seats in the first two decades, but the
demography has changed continually since the 1980s. Cortalim consists
of a large number of migrant labourers settled in Zuarinagar, while
Navelim consists of in-migrant Hindus and Christians and equally large
numbers of local Hindus who have migrated from the New Conquests. In
spite of this, religion never became a deciding factor in electing the
MLA. Neither the MGP nor the BJP could find roots here, and neither
could a candidate belonging to the Hindu community ever succeed.

The third category consists of 14 seats out of a total of 24, more
than half. It also consists of major commercial or port towns in the
Old Conquests, such as Mapusa, Panaji, Margao, Vasco, and Mormugao,
which have always remained dominated by Hindus. But even these towns
have been electing Christian candidates so far, such as Francisco
D’Souza and his son Joshua in Mapusa from 1999 to 2017, once on the
Goa Rajiv Congress ticket and then under the BJP banner.

With the port town getting congested, Dabolim constituency was carved
out of Mormugao constituency, which included more than half of the
port town and Zuarinagar too. It was then renamed as Vasco after Goa
became a State. From the 2009 Lok Sabha election and 2012 of the
Assembly, Vasco was separated from Dabolim, limiting it to the main
town. This segment with Hindu majority but sizeable Christians, has
elected Christian MLAs like Adv Herculano Dourado (1980) and Simon
D’Souza (1984 &1989) of the Congress, Dr Wilfred Mesquita (1994) of
the MGP, Jose Philip D’Souza (1999/2007) of UGDP and NCP, and Carlos
Almeida (2012/2017) of the BJP. Even today, it has a Christian
population of hardly 15 per cent. (We have already discussed Mormugao
earlier).

But at the same time, the Christian domination is so strong that the
Congress Chief Minister, Digambar Kamat, during his single five-year
tenure from 2007-12, had to accommodate seven Christian MLAs in his
12-member cabinet. Most of them were from Salcete taluka. Even today,
the Pramod Sawantled BJP government has five Christian ministers and a
Deputy Speaker.

In spite of being such a dominant force, Goa could never get a
Christian chief minister through a public mandate, other than Luizinho
Faleiro, the sole exception. In 1999, the Congress achieved the magic
figure of 21 which led to Faleiro becoming the chief
minister. Otherwise, all other Christian chief ministers have seized
power by toppling the ‘popular’ governments through defections and
horse trading. They include Churchill Alemao (1990), Dr Luis Proto
Barbosa (1990), Dr Wilfred de Souza (1993 & 1998) and Francisco
Sardinha (1999).

Realising the non-religious attitude of the Goan voter, the BJP
master-strategist, Manohar Parrikar, had to change his electoral
tactics by going soft, even on Soft Hindutva, and follow the Congress
line of ‘appeasement of the minorities’. Parrikar never succeeded in
‘Mission Salcete’ but could reach the magic figure of 21 in 2012 by
winning 12 seats in the Old Conquests, by fielding Christian
candidates in those constituencies.

It is perhaps for the first time in the history of Goan politics that
the AAP leader, Arvind Kejriwal, has made an open statement that his
deputy chief minister would be a Christian.  The same AAP, had
side-lined Elvis Gomes after promoting him as the CM face, claiming
that his Christian face was becoming a liability. And now the ‘over
smart’ party is also receiving flak from the common Goan for
encouraging Bhandari and Christian politics. Not only the Delhi-based
AAP, but none of the so-called ‘outsider’ parties have been able to
comprehend the dynamics and spirit of Bahujan politics of Goa.

Unlike the rest of India, Goa has a different history due to the
brutal policy of religious conversions that the Portuguese
adopted. Goans were undoubtedly victims of the conversions as well as
the Inquisition against the neo-converts. But this coin has another
side. Due to the conversion policy, which the Portuguese did not
implement while winning over the New Conquests, we have a mix of two
major religions in Goa, divided into two Conquests. Due to this,
religion-based political parties cannot play their fanatic politics in
Goa. In that sense (not otherwise) the religious conversions have been
a blessing in disguise for this tiny state on the western coast of
India!
