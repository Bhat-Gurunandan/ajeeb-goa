# The 'State of Migrants

Unlike the rest of India, Goa is a state formed by four kinds of major
migrations. Two among them are similar to the rest of India while the
other two are unique. To analyse local politics, knowing the history
of migrations is of utmost importance. We have already analysed two
migrations that took place in Goa. One, from the early settlers to the
settlements followed by the different dynasties and the role they
played in shaping up Goa’s polity. The second one is unique to Goa,
caused by Portuguese colonialism and the religious conversions of
Hindus and Muslims as well as the horrific Inquisition inflicted upon
the converted Goan Christians. This saga resulted in a series of
migrations, first by the Hindus in the 16th and 17th centuries and
then by the neoconverts, especially in the 17th century.

Then came a major spate of migration of Goans, which gained momentum
from the 19th century. The decaying economic situation in Goa, in the
Estado da India, and the opportunities thrown up all over the world
led to the migration of many aspiring people from the Christian
community of Goa.  This migration still continues. In the last three
decades Goa’s educated Hindu population has also been migrating in a
big way, due to lack of opportunities in their home State.

On the other hand, Goa has also been witnessing inward migration from
all over India after liberation in 1961. One, largely by the labour
class and lower middle class, to seize the employment and professional
opportunities which the locals shy away from. And the second migration
is by the ‘cream’ of India’s elite society, which is buying land at
throwaway prices and settling down in Goa. Having a holiday home in
Goa has become a big craze among the wealthy class of India and also
among the foreigners.

To understand Goa’s politics, it is necessary to travel down history
and perceive the mindset of Goan voters, who consist of those who had
migrated to Goa centuries ago, the new migrant population of this
century, as well as the Goans who out-migrate to work but remain
strongly connected with the concerns and welfare of their motherland.

## More Christians Than Hindus Left Goa?

We know that Goa was historically divided into two Goas − the Velhas
Conquistas (Old Conquests) and Nova Conquistas (New Conquests). By
1788, when the eight talukas of the latter were annexed to Goa, the
Portuguese had changed their policy on religious conversions. They had
agreed to respect the traditions and customs of their population. The
Inquisition, though finally abolished in 1812, had lost its teeth when
it was suspended in 1774 and revived four years later.

The Christians found in the New Conquests today are the migrants from
the Old Conquests, they are not local converts.[^1] Having been
ill-treated by the Portuguese regime as inferior citizens, especially
those from the Sudir caste, they shifted to the New Conquests as
landless agricultural labourers, toddy tappers, and fishermen. They
could buy their own land and build houses only when they started
working overseas on hard labour jobs as seamen, as well as in the
Gulf, and now in the UK.

But it is not true that Christians were always a minority in Goa. Even
after the New Conquests were annexed to Estado da India, the
Christians were the majority. The official figures of the Portuguese
Census indicate that way back in 1850, Christians comprised 64 per
cent of Goa’s population. Out of a total of 3.64 lakh population,
Christians were 2.32 lakh and Hindus 1.29 lakh; a difference of over
one lakh. But by the end of the century, the situation had changed
drastically. It had come down to 50:50. The major proportionate drop
was in the first three decades, till 1881. The Christian population
did rise, but by only 10,000 (2.41 lakh). The Hindu population on the
other hand rose by one lakh (2.30 lakh). And by 1910, Hindus (2.70
lakh) were equal to the Christian (2.68 lakh) population.
Subsequently, not only in terms of percentage, but even in terms of
number, the Christian population kept on declining till Goa was
liberated in 1961. From 1850 to 1960, the whole picture had
reversed. Hindus (3.54 lakh) were one lakh more than the Christians
(2.25 lakh).

Was it a state-wide transition? It was, but to a large extent
in the Old Conquests. Let’s analyse the following graph, which
shows the percentage of religions in 1848, 1961 and 2011.

In the Old Conquests, the Christian population has declined
substantially, from 88 per cent to 35 per cent. Comparatively, it has
declined marginally from 15 to 11 per cent in the New Conquests over
one and a half centuries. In contrast, the decline and rise of Hindus
in the Old and New Conquests appears quite reasonable up to 1961.

A further break-up of the population in the talukas of both the
conquests clearly indicates that the major decline in the Christian
population happened in the Bardez taluka. There was a huge drop by 60
per cent in 163 years, till 2011. The Christian population in Tiswadi
dropped to half (50 per cent), followed by Salcete, where Christians
reduced by 40 per cent. No talukawise break-up of 1848 is available
for the New Conquests. But the Christian population also dropped there
by 31 per cent from Liberation to 2011.

Population numbers always keep increasing in society even if family
planning is practiced vigorously. However, the percentage either drops
or rises due to two reasons. Here in this case it was outward
migration (emigration) of Christians from Goa and inward migration of
Hindus from outside Goa.  Obviously, there was no reason for the
Hindus to migrate to Goa till it was liberated. But the prime reason
for the decline of Christian population appears to be emigration.

It means that not only did the Hindus migrate to settle outside Goa
during the Portuguese regime but the Christians did so too. It began
during the Inquisition, perhaps in large numbers in the 17th century,
when the neo-converts could not bear the forceful de-culturalisation
and migrated to the Konkan belt in Maharashtra and Belgaum as well as
to North Canara in Karnataka.

The second major emigration is recorded at the end of the 17th
century, when Chatrapati Sambhaji of the Maratha empire had almost
captured Goa in 1683 and the Portuguese Governor had actually pleaded
for divine intervention by placing his sceptre on the relics of St
Francis Xavier at Old Goa.

Goa’s history would have been different if the Mughals had not invaded
the Maratha territories at that point of time, due to which Sambhaji
had to retreat from Goa. However, after this episode, by the beginning
of the 18th century, native Christians had started migrating to
Karnataka. Almost 40,000 Christians are reported to have been settled
across the Portuguese borders, returning annually only to collect
their zonn (dividend) from their respective Communidades.[^2]

Goans began working for the British when the naval fleet of the
British Indian government was stationed in Goa between 1797 and 1813,
in anticipation of an attack by the French (which never took
place). They employed Goan Christians due to their familiarity with
Western culture. When the British fleet withdrew from Goa and
established stations in Bombay, Karachi, Madras, Calcutta and
Singapore their Goan staff followed them.  Later, after the War of
Independence in 1857, the British began setting up a vast railway
network for the quick movement of troops, including in Goa. The Goans
poured out and got jobs in the railway-related works and subsequently
settled in large numbers in Hubli, Belgaum, Mumbai, and Pune.[^3]

Then occurred a major exodus, largely of Christians,
when the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty was signed in 1878 and Goa
became the prime supplier of labour to British India. Official
figures from Portuguese records show that 3.23 lakh Goans had
left Estado da India (Portuguese Goa) and settled in Bombay as
the citizens of British India, in just 30 years, from 1880 to 1910.
Ninety-two per cent among them were from the Old Conquests.
Obviously, the majority of them were Christians. Besides
Bombay, some of them also settled in Madras and Bengal.[^4]

There have been two separate studies conducted to estimate the exodus
of Goans during this period till 1910, when the Portuguese monarchy
was replaced by the Republic.  The first one was conducted by two
researchers from Portugal and the Netherlands: Paulo Teodoro de Matos
of the Instituto Universitário de Lisboa in Lisboa and Jan Lucassen of
the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. Of the
total number of 37,345 passports granted between 1847 and 1855 by
Estado da India from Goa, they selected 2,042 passports, corresponding
to a sample of 5.5% (constant for each year).

They found that almost all the applicants (96%) went to Bombay. Most
of the migrants were from the Old Conquests, largely from Bardez
(67%), and nearly 90 per cent of them were Christians. Only 6
Christians from 1787 (a sample) were from the New Conquests. The rest
of the 55 were Hindus from the New Conquests. Comparatively, hardly
seven per cent of Hindus migrated from the Old Conquests.

The second study recorded by Dr Remy Dias shows the real magnitude of
the exodus over three decades, from 1880 to 1910. Over 3.23 lakh Goans
left Goa, mainly to Bombay, and a few of them went to Madras and
Bengal, up to Karachi (today in Pakistan due to which they have lost
their ancestral land in Goa, as India considers it ‘Enemy Property’!).

It was the Old Conquests (92%) once again with Bardezkars (48%)
topping the list, which was almost half of the total number of
emigrants. The volume of annual migration doubled in the second half
of the period. Saxttikars were next in numbers and there were around
25,000 from Tiswadi. Equivalent to the onetime Island of Goa were the
Goans from the whole of the New Conquests. On an average, 4000 Goans
left the state for good every year.

The trend of emigration continued till Goa was liberated, and also for
various other reasons like the economic blockade imposed by
independent India. Many people left their land because their
family-earners in India could not remit money to Goa freely.[^7] Besides,
a series of epidemics that broke out at the beginning of the 20th
century, especially of influenza, hit the Old Conquests taking a heavy
toll of lives.

The third study is an official document of the Government of Goa,
called Goa Migration Study 2008. It’s a sample survey conducted by the
NRI Commission of Goa of 6000 households selected by the Stratified
Multistage Random Sampling Method.  Of these, 3100 households studied
in the report are from the three major talukas of the Old Conquests:
Salcete, Tiswadi and Bardez. The report examines various aspects of
the life of these Goans, who travelled outside Goa as emigrants
(settled outside) as well as migrants (moved out for jobs, education,
etc.) as well as returned-emigrants and returned-migrants, who
resettled in Goa.

As per this study, almost 60,000 Goans had migrated in 1931, out of
which 45,000 settled in Bombay, 3500 in Karachi, 1000 in Calcutta and
800 in Rangoon, besides other parts of India. Nearly 85 per cent among
them were Christians; only 7500 were Hindus and Muslims. After
recession hit British India in 1930, many Goans either returned home
or went to the Gulf. But in 1938, around 55,000 Goans were left
behind.  After World War II, as Bombay grew as a business centre, the
number soared to one lakh, out of which the majority occupied
positions in business, liberal professions and administration, as well
as in public services like restaurants, guest houses, and tailoring
shops. By the time Pakistan was created, several Goans there had
established business houses and large public companies which they
headed as their chief executives. Many streets in Karachi were named
after eminent Goans. However, many young Goans left Karachi. In 1958,
Karachi had 5000 Goans.[^8]

The trend of out-migration, especially by the Christian community,
continues till date. Due to this, in the last 60 years since
liberation, the 38 per cent Christian population of Goa has reduced to
25 per cent; from one-third to one-fourth of Goa’s total
population. These are the figures from the 2011 census. The 2021
census is certainly expected to show further reduction, also because a
large chunk of the population has migrated to the UK during this
decade, by adopting Portuguese citizenship and giving up their Indian
citizenship.

If not for this huge exodus of Christians, the political scenario
vis-a-vis elections would have been totally different today. Goa would
have continued to be a Christian-dominated state. This issue cropped
up significantly during the Opinion Poll of 1967, when Dr Jack de
Sequeira’s United Goans Party demanded voting rights for the Goan
expatriates. Did they get the right to decide about the identity of
their state? It is one of the interesting episodes in the chapter in
this book, dedicated to this unique historic and exciting referendum
held in the Indian Republic.

## Foreigner Goenkars

The next phase saw Goans migrating abroad and settling in those
respective countries. This again consisted largely of Christians,
since it was considered inauspicious and taboo for Hindus to cross the
seas. The Hindus would actually be outcasts from the community if they
did so. Hence, the number of Hindus migrating abroad was
negligible. The Portuguese economy in Goa had almost collapsed,
agriculture did not bear enough fruits for a comfortable living, and
the promotion of education threw up new opportunities for the
neglected Christians in Goan society. The migration began with East
African countries in 1895 and then took a real leap from the first
decade of the 20th century.

Margaret Frenz, a historian and Oxford University scholar who has
studied migrations across the world, has written extensively on
migrations from Asia and also specifically from Goa. According to her,
the main focus of Goan migrations was on East Africa. Goans migrated
in two phases: in the first decade to settle in East Africa, and then
in the second half of the 20th century to settle across the ‘western
world’ in the UK, Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil,
Portugal, and other countries. She not only deals with migrations but
also with how Goans settled down in different countries of Africa as a
Goan community, their social and cultural behaviour, and their active
involvement in local politics.[^9]

It sounds quite interesting when their brothers and sisters living in
Goa today keep grumbling about the ‘invasion’ of Goa by our own Indian
migrants from other states, especially the labour and trading class,
whom we humiliate as Ghantis. More interestingly, our Goans living
abroad are now financing the political outfits that have sprung up in
Goa to fight elections on the grounds of ethnicity, with their
vote-guns pointed at the politicians who nurture vote banks of
migrants. But when the migration of Goans abroad is studied from a
socio-cultural viewpoint, their tales sound similar to what we witness
among the migrants in Goa today.

### EAST AFRICA

The Industrial Revolution in Europe and the USA had a direct
repercussion on Estado da India in terms of new opportunities for
employment, including self-employment.  The destination was British
colonies in East Africa. The first Goan ‘pioneers’ migrated in 1895 to
Zanzibar, an island in Tanzania, to work in the administrative units
of the Imperial British East Africa Company and then to Mombasa,
Dar-es-Salaam, and Nairobi between 1900 to 1907, once again to work in
the administrative setup of the construction companies of Uganda
Railway. By 1911, around 1200 Goan clerical officers worked in the
Kenyan and Uganda administrations. The treasury and audit departments
were completely in Goan hands. It was a three-tiered system on ethnic
lines, with Europeans in the top tier, African staff in the lower
ranks, and Indians (including Goans) in the middle.

A chain movement then started off, of getting Goan family members,
relatives, and fellow villagers to work in different parts of East
Africa, not only in the administrative service but also in various
professions and business enterprises in which Goans had
expertise. This included hotels, restaurants, bars, bakeries, photo
studios, tailoring shops, teaching, healthcare, law firms, etc. The
following table is a census conducted in these countries, where Goans
were listed separately and not with other Indians since they came from
the Portuguese Estado da India.

The major attraction however was the ‘government service’ since it had
a hefty salary, a permanent position, prospects for promotion and
other benefits, as well as six-months of leave every four years. This
allowed Goans to visit their homes in Goa regularly and leave their
children behind with their grandparents for ‘good education’ in Goa.

The sports and culture-loving Goans set up their own clubs in major
cities, conducting sports tournaments, regular parties, dances, and
celebrating their own festivals. Marriages took place strictly within
the Goan community through these regular social interactions at the
clubs, sports events, and schools meant for Goan communities. The most
popular sport was hockey, followed by badminton, cricket, tennis,
table tennis, billiards, and others.

Besides village communities celebrating their Goan festivals locally,
the feast of St Francis Xavier was celebrated throughout East Africa
on the 3rd of December each year. Quite a number of East African
Catholic churches were built with generous Goan support, including
prominent ones like the St Francis Xavier Church in Nairobi, and
Christ the King Cathedral in Kampala.

Goans in East African countries were also active in politics. The
freedom movement in India had an impact on the nationalist movement in
East Africa. With their involvement in local politics, two Goans
reached one of the highest positions in Kenya. Joseph Murumbi
(1911-1990) and Pio Gama Pinto (1927-1965) were the second
vice-presidents of Kenya. Pinto was shot dead in 1965, the first
victim of a series of political assassinations.

However, the situation changed drastically in the 1960s when East
Africa achieved independence and nation-states were created with
international boundaries. Uganda attained independence in 1962 and Idi
Amin seized power in early 1971. Zanzibar and Kenya became independent
in 1963 and Mozambique in 1975. Meanwhile Goa was also freed from the
four-and-a-half century colonial rule of the Portuguese in
1961. There was total Africanisation of the local administration
all across East Africa. New immigration acts came into force
and the rights of Commonwealth citizens (including Indian
Goans) grew restricted in terms of citizenship. Furthermore, the
revolution in Zanzibar in 1964, the expulsion of Asians from
Uganda in 1972, and the coup in Kenya in 1982 created an
atmosphere of apprehension in the Goan community.

Goans had no other option than to leave. But very few Goans came back
to Goa and hardly anyone preferred Portugal.  Most of them moved to
other industrialised western countries like the UK, Canada, USA,
Australia, New Zealand, Brazil etc.

In 1972, approximately 29,000 Asians arrived in the UK from Uganda,
including Goans. One survey conducted by the Goan community in 1970
found 5000 Goans settled in London city alone. While 80 per cent among
them found white collar jobs, others had to start afresh or work in
lower positions and work their way up in various careers, from
hairdressers to university professors and IT and finance
professionals. Margaret Frenz writes that in 2007, there were 800
Goans left in Kenya, 500 in Tanzania, 100 in Zanzibar and 50 in
Uganda.[^10]

### USA

Goan settlers began arriving in the US from East Africa around 80
years ago. In 1990, the US had 5000 Goan families, mostly Goan
Christians.[^11] However, the 21st century has witnessed a large
migration of Goan Hindus to the US, mainly as IT professionals. Till
January 2020, 12.80 lakh Indians are recorded to be living in the US,
which, of course, includes Goans.[^12]

### PORTUGAL 

Despite Goa being a colony of Portugal for over four centuries, the
number of Goans settled in Portugal is less compared to other European
countries. The embassy of India in Portugal, on its website, states
that there are 90,000 people belonging to Indian-origin diaspora and
another 30,000 Indian nationals. However the Goans there − all
Catholics – number barely 15,000. In fact, the Indian Hindus in
Portugal amount to almost the largest chunk of which comes from
Gujarat (40,000), probably including Daman and Diu, followed by Punjab
(30,000), Haryana (10,000) and Kerala (2000). The Sikhs are 35,000 and
Muslims are 20,000.[^13] Another study conducted in 1992 states that
there are 11,000 Goans in Portugal, of whom 6000 live in Lisbon.[^14]

However this may not include the Goans, mostly Hindu goldsmiths, who
had migrated in the early 16th century, or the upper-class Christians
and Hindus who moved there in the second half of the 19th
century. Most of them migrated for higher education and settled there
as clerks, doctors, engineers, lawyers, magistrates, teachers,
journalists, officials in armed forces, and bureaucrats.

> “There are thus broadly four distinct groups of Goans who have settled
> in Portugal; (i) those who came straight from Goa and settled down in
> Portugal during the colonial regime, which can be classified as
> pre-1961; (ii) those who came from Goa post-1961 after Goa was taken
> over by India; (iii) those who came via Africa, especially the former
> Portuguese colonies, particularly after the independence of Angola and
> Mozambique; and (iv) more recently those who have migrated to Portugal
> with a view to settling in other developed countries in Europe or
> elsewhere."[^15]

The latest migration Goa is presently witnessing for the last three
decades is that of thousands of Goans, mostly Christians but also
including some Hindus. They have taken advantage of the provision in
Portuguese law that allows those born before Goa’s liberation in
December 1961 and two generations thereafter to opt for Portuguese
nationality. As Portuguese citizens, they are EU passport holders and
thus eligible to move, live, and work across the bloc. However, it
needs to be seen how much the decision of BREXIT, the exit of the UK
from the EU, will affect the ongoing migration of Goans to the UK via
Portugal.

The British government has already assured enough security to those
who are already working there. Two types of status will be granted to
Goan-origin Portuguese and other EU citizens: Settled status for those
who have lived in the UK for five years or more, and pre-settled
status for those who have been in the UK for less than five years.

No authentic figures are available to ascertain how many Goans have
given up their Indian citizenship, adopted Portuguese citizenship, and
actually migrated to the UK.

> “The citizenship is granted directly in Lisbon by the Central Civil
> Registrar… There are an estimated 17,000 Goans with Portuguese
> citizenship living in the UK. Only a minority of these migrants remain
> in Portugal. According to an unconfirmed source, there is currently a
> waiting list of 12 to 13 thousand for passports at the Portuguese
> consulate in Goa and a few thousand passports are issued to such
> applicants each year.  There are also some recent instances of
> non-Goans who have sought to apply for Portuguese nationality, using
> false papers.”[^16]

Goans when settled abroad not only assimilated into their new
countries but some of them also played a major role in politics. Some
of them reached the highest possible positions.  Portugal had two
prime ministers of Goan origin and four in ministerial
positions. Similarly, Kenya had a Goan as the second
vice-president. The following table has listed 15 Goans who reached
high positions in four countries. Half of them were born in Goa and
then migrated to the respective countries.

One among them, Sayonara Luxton, the Mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead
in the UK, was brought up in Goa, schooled in Mapusa, and then moved
to Dubai at the age of 21. She then moved to the UK
in 1993. Recognising her social work among the drug-addicted
youngsters, her town elected her as councillor. She then rose to the
position of deputy mayor and eventually became Mayor.

While we proudly celebrate the elevation of our Goenkars in political
positions in foreign countries, in Goa, we look at our own Indian
migrants as a ‘threat to Goa’ if they rise up in political positions
after working sincerely in social and political fields. Is Goa’s
politics stooping to regional and ethnic fanaticism while our bright
Goans with a worldwide vision shine in different parts of the world?
Goa’s ‘broadminded’ politics needs introspection indeed!

### GULF 

The oil boom in the Gulf region of Middle East in the 1960s and 1970s
lasted till early 1990s. Thousands of Goans, from the Old and New
Conquests, largely Christians but also Hindus, made fortunes by
working at various levels in the Gulf.

> “There were 50,000 Goans in Kuwait, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the 70s and
> a total of 150,000 Goans in the Gulf in 1987. Goan migration to the
> Middle East was never a permanent phenomenon since the countries in
> that region do not grant citizenship to foreign nationals; however,
> many have spent decades there. Goans still prefer to move to those
> countries, believing that a job there would be more rewarding than
> employment in Goa.”[^17]

[^17]: Goa Migration Study 2008

Goans who migrated to the Middle East have not settled there
permanently, neither do Goans who are now going to the UK with
Portuguese citizenship have plans to settle in Europe.  But unlike the
Gulf Goans, the ‘Portuguese Goans’ have given up their citizenship. In
both these categories, Goa has received a huge amount of remittances,
which are being invested in education, medical treatment and
housing. However, since India has no system of dual citizenship like
the Portuguese, these migrated Goans have opted for OCI (Overseas
Citizen of India) cards, in order to have a hold over their properties
in Goa. But this is not a permanent solution.

> “Remittances to Goa, around Rs 700 crore (annually) have a
> significant effect on the economy. Remittances are 6.3 per cent of
> the State Domestic Product of Goa. Remittances are one-third of the
> revenue receipt of Goa but only 6 per cent of the Government
> expenditure.”

But this has slowed down substantially due to the worldwide pandemic
of Covid19. Thousands of migrants working abroad as well as the
emigrants have come down to Goa. They have no source of income. Their
future is uncertain since it is not known when the waves of Covid19
will permanently die down. While the Christian community, especially
in the Old Conquests, is fuming over this, it would not be surprising
if this becomes a major election issue. But, right now, no political
party seems to be seriously applying its mind over this economic
crisis.

### Are Migrants Outgrowing Goans?

The emigration of Christian Goans did not stop after Goa’s
liberation. But the trend of leaving Goa and settling outside did slow
down. In fact many Christians who had settled in other Portuguese
colonies in East Africa came back to their motherland. Despite this,
the Christian population of Goa has kept shrinking.

The graph below shows a decline in Christian population
even after liberation, in the last 50 years. In the New Conquests,
it has declined marginally from 15 to 11 per cent. But in the
Old Conquests, it has slipped down from 56 per cent to 35 per
cent.[^18] That’s stunning!

[^18]: Census of India

The graph shows that this trend in the last 50 years (till 2011
census) is more visible in the Old Conquests, where the Hindu
population has increased substantially, by almost 13 per cent.  Added
to this is the eight per cent rise in the Muslim population, though
small in numbers. This has affected the number of Christians in the
Old Conquests. There is a sharp decline of 21 per cent, due to
emigration as well as in-migration of non-Christians.

A few Christians however have also migrated to Goa from coastal states
like Kerala or tribal hilly states like Jharkhand.  But the emigration
of the Christian community is not the sole reason for its declining
population in Goa. Added to this is the huge amount of in-migration of
Indian Hindus and Muslims from other states due to which Christian
population is proportionately declining. The Christian population at
the time of Goa’s liberation was 2.25 lakhs. Today, it has risen to
3.66 lakhs, a steady rise of around 62 per cent. But compared to this,
the Hindu population has soared in the last 50 years from 3.54 lakhs
to 9.64 lakhs, a rise of 150 per cent. The Muslim population has also
risen from 12,000 in 1961 to 1.22 lakhs in 2011, generally due to
in-migration.

It’s an interesting phenomenon that Goan Christians go all over the
world and set up shop and take up different professions in the service
industry. But similar opportunities in Goa are overlooked by
them. This vacuum is then filled by Indian migrants from other states,
especially in trade and business. Goa’s migrant population does not
include the working class labourers alone but also the middle class
traders, upper middle class professionals and also the upper class
retired elite of India. In addition, most celebrities in India have a
second home in Goa.

But what is the actual migrant population residing in Goa today, since
1961? Unfortunately, no government has bothered to conduct any
extensive survey in this regard nor has any political party demanded
it. However the politicians are busy competing with each other to win
over these ‘vote banks’ by providing them basic amenities like
housing, water, electricity, ration, etc., not as their basic right as
Indian citizens, but as ‘favours’. The only data available is the
Census conducted every 10 years by the central government. But it is
not very accurate in the count of migrants since they have different
criteria set to measure the in-migration.

The quantifying of migrant population is a complex exercise but it is
needed to understand the current demographics of Goa.  Understanding
this is of utmost importance because there are sweeping statements
made by responsible leaders of the society including ministers,
businessmen, educationists, and even priests, that migrants from other
states are flooding the state in a big way. If this trend continues,
Goans would be pushed into a minority. Is it true? Let us examine
this.

The table below shows some interesting statistics. It shows the
decadal growth in Goa’s rural and urban population.  Urbanisation is a
normal trend in which we always find an increase in urban population
and a decline in rural population.  In the first decade after Goa’s
liberation, in 1971, the rural population shows a normal growth of 18
per cent. Despite this, the urban population has grown by 133 per
cent. Obviously, this is not just due to Goan villagers rushing to the
cities but due to a huge influx of migrants.

The Census report also observes that the migrants did not consist of
merely the working class but also others who cited various
opportunities due to the developmental works taken up by the Indian
and Goa government. As a Union Territory, opportunities sprang up in
the field of education, health, transport, and construction work. For
example, Goa’s 614 educational institutes in 1960 increased to 1441,
including a few colleges in the cities and primary schools all across
the Goan countryside. This brought in a large number of teachers,
especially from Maharashtra. Goa had only 38 hospitals and health
centres, which rose to 262, creating job opportunities for doctors,
nurses, compounders etc. The construction activities taken up to
develop infrastructure needed labour. This led to migration from
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu etc.

The following table compiled from the Census reports
explains it with a state-wise break-up. It is based on the
information recorded about a person living in Goa but was born
in another state. Of course it includes a Goan born outside the
state and does not include a migrant child born in Goa. But it
still certainly provides a rough picture. Unfortunately, this data
is not available beyond the 1981 census.

Even during Portuguese rule, Goa had migrants, not
only from other states of India but also from other countries,
besides 6689 Portuguese. There were 461 Africans, French,
Germans, Italians, Egyptians, Spanish, Japanese and even
Chinese. None of them are found in the 1971 census. The
total number of migrants from within India was 6085. This
number however jumped to nearly one lakh in the first ten
years and then went on swelling every decade. In 1991, it
rose to 1.70 lakhs, but interestingly, reduced to 1.20 lakhs in
2001. The census figures of migrants in the 2011 census have
not yet been released.

Why is the number of ‘migrants’ reducing? The reason
is found again in the Census. By 1991, almost half of these
migrants were found to be living in Goa for more than 10 and
20 years. Almost one-fourth of them live for more than 10 years,
and around 18 per cent for more than 20 years. No figures in
this category are available in the 2001 Census and the 2011
figures are not yet out. While these figures are derived from the
state they were born in, their children were born in Goa and
even their parents have become Niz Goenkar since they have
been living here for the last 50 years. A large chunk of them also
speak fluent Konkani. This assumption is proved by yet another
Census finding, based on their mother tongue.

These figures of the mother tongue simply don’t match with the figures
of migrants from other states. For example, we know that people from
Karnataka are still migrating. In 1981 they numbered 72,000. Three
decades after that, there are only 68,000 Kannada-speaking people. It
means the onetime Kannadigas have assimilated in Goan soil and have
been registering their mother tongue as Konkani. Let’s take yet
another example. The most humiliated Indian community (Ghanti) among
these are the Lamanis, who are also called Banjara. The Goa Banjara
Samaj President Suresh Rajput once told me in a TV debate that over
one lakh Lamanis are settled in Goa and they have come from different
states. Despite this, in the 2011 Census, only 9028 have registered
their mother tongue either as Lamani or Banjari.

This can be also argued as a well-planned design of the migrants in
order to grab all kinds of benefits Goans get.  Do they get these
benefits? There was a survey conducted in 2006 by Children’s Rights in
Goa (CRG), an NGO working for the welfare and rights of children of
Goa. The survey was fully focussed on Goa’s migrant labour and their
children.  The findings were a real eye opener, exploding all kinds of
myths we believe about migrant labourers. Let me cite a few of them:

More than one-third of migrant labourers have been living in Goa for
over 15 years and legally fall in a domicile category, meaning they
are Goans by all measures. More than half of them live in rented
premises, 16 per cent live in their own houses and hardly eight per
cent live in shanties (slums). Fish and rice is a staple food for over
half of them and 17 per cent among them eat Xit-Koddi. Nearly 60 per
cent of the adults and over 80 per cent of children speak Hindi, but
over 40 per cent of adults and nearly 65 per cent of children also
speak Konkani. They are the vote bank of politicians, this is the
usual allegation. In reality, half of them don’t vote and 20 per cent
of them vote in their native states since they have no local voting
cards. Almost two third of them want to settle in Goa and 96 per cent
of children ‘like’ Goa.[^20]

Do we find it surprising? What did our ancestors do?  The first
settlers of Mundari tribe came from Chota Nagpur in Bihar. This was
followed by ‘migrants’ (Ghanti?) coming from Indian states like
Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat,
Maharashtra, etc. as well as foreign countries like Afghanistan,
Pakistan, Iraq, Europe, Arab countries etc. After living here for many
generations and getting assimilated completely with the local
language, culture and lifestyle, we call ourselves Niz Goenkars. Not
enough; we − the migrants at one time − call the new migrants Ghantis
and look at them as a threat!

At the same time, we Goans go all over the world to work, settle
there, assimilate there and even establish ourselves successfully in
all kinds of fields, from business to politics. When some of them
become mayors and presidents of the country, it’s a proud moment for
us. Not a threat to those respective countries! Is this not a double
standard? Let’s introspect.

Why do we look at the neo-migrants as a threat to Goa? Because we go
out and they come in. We seize the opportunities available all around
the world while they jump at the opportunities getting created in
Goa. And then we fear that one day they will outgrow us. Goa’s
politics has been moving around this anxiety. Is there truth in this
unknown fear?

The table of the people who have registered their mother tongue as
Konkani or Marathi, coupled with the people who were born outside Goa;
in Maharashtra. The figures of Marathi speaking and Maharashtrians
simply do not match. When the Konkani-Marathi controversy started
heating up in Goa, a call was given by Marathi protagonists to the
Goans to register their mother tongue as Marathi. In response, the
number of Goans calling themselves ‘Marathi’ went on rising till the
historic official language agitation of 1986.

The issue was finally resolved in 1987, around which time the Census
of 1991 was also conducted. In the heat of agitation, the number of
‘Marathis’ rose up to 3.90 lakh, which was almost half of the
‘Konkanis’ registered in the Census. With the language controversy
cooling down in the 21st century and the new generation opting for
Konkani, the number of ‘Marathi Goans’ has now reduced to half of the
number registered in the 2001 Census. It is bound to reduce further in
the 2021 Census.  The graph is a clear indication of the trend.

It needs to be seen how many ‘Marathi Goans’ remain in the 2021
Census, along with the Goans born in Maharashtra.  But even without
them, the number of Konkani-speaking Goans remains three times more
than the migrants. And if we add so called Marathi-speaking Goans to
it, the number of migrants slips to one-fourth of Goa’s population. In
that case, are we fighting a non-existent demon? Is it worth fighting
elections on these fanatic grounds by aiming at soft targets like the
migrant workers, whom Goa needs for our daily existence? Are we
missing the target? Are they the real enemies of Goa? Or are the land
sharks the real enemies, who are grabbing our land and selling it to
build holiday homes to those for whom Goa is nothing but a holiday
destination to exploit? And who are the ones who are selling our land
to the land sharks? Friends of Goa? Are they Niz Goenkar? Bhumiputras?
