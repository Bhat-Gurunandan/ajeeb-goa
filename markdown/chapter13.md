# The Politics of Land

Whether it was the revolutionary Assembly election of 1963 or the
historic Opinion Poll of 1967, it was a battle for land. The land you
cultivate, the land on which you have built a house, or the whole land
of Goa you belong to. Precisely this is the reason the majority of
Goans voted for the MGP but rejected its mergerist agenda. And
precisely due to the same reason the pro-farmer ‘reformist’ Bhau
Bandodkar was elected back to power in 1967 with 16 seats and once
again in 1972 with 18 seats. After his sudden demise in 1973, his
daughter Shashikala Kakodkar carried forward his legacy successfully.

In 1975, the MGP government brought about yet another ‘socialist’
legislation, the Goa, Daman and Diu Mundkars (Protection from
eviction) Act, 1975.[^1] Right in the beginning the Act states: It is
meant to provide for better protection to mundkars against eviction
from their dwelling houses and for granting them the right to purchase
the same and to make certain other provisions connected therewith,
where such houses have been built at a reasonable price; it is
expedient to abolish the system of free services rendered by mundkars
and turn it into a remunerated one.

Following this, based on an extensive land survey conducted by the
government, the MGP government in 1976 amended the Agricultural
Tenancy Act 1964, with a fifth amendment. At last, the tenant who was
paying one-sixth of their agricultural produce for 12 years, was made
the deemed owner of the cultivable land, provided he purchased it
through legal procedures. He was free from the clutches of
Bhatkarshai.  Was he? Was the dream fulfilled?

## Dragging Cases & Snailing Courts

As per the procedure laid down in the Act, the Mamlatdar or the Deputy
Collector is authorised to complete the formalities including hearing
the case and issue a Sanad of ownership to the tenant. The Assembly
sessions are full of questions asked by the MLAs about the pending
cases of tenancy. The latest one was asked by Ponda MLA Ravi Naik in
2021 regarding pending cases since 2012. Revenue Minister Jennifer
Monserrate replied that 2846 cases are still pending and only 527
sanads have been issued in 10 years.[^2] Similarly, 819 cases of
Mundkars are still pending. In the last 10 years, 2296 mundkars have
officially purchased their house from the Bhatkars while 1147 have
still not been able to purchase the houses, in spite of declaring them
as deemed owners.[^3]

The legislations were enacted in 1975-76, but the actual
implementation started in the last decade of the 20th century, after
1990, almost 15 years later. Even after three decades the tillers have
not become the deemed owners of the cultivable land or their
houses. Isn’t it a tragedy of Indian democracy?  The MGP was supported
mainly by the people from the New Conquests. But still suffering are a
large number of people from the Old Conquests. The pending cases in
each taluka of the Old Conquests are between 500 to 750. A few
hundreds have become owners of their rightful land in the last 10
years.

Similar is the plight of the mundkars. More cases are pending
in the Old Conquests than the New Conquests. In eight talukas
of the New Conquests, only 318 people have not been able to
purchase their houses in spite of their cases being disposed of.
But in the Old Conquests, over 700 families in four talukas have
not been able to purchase their houses. Is this the reason they
are still migrating even at the cost of giving up their citizenship,
as they could raise money to either buy their mundkarial houses
or build a decent house in the place of a hut-like structure? No
political party or the elected legislator has bothered to inquire
about their plight.

## Delay Tactics Of Bhatkars

Nearly six decades have passed but the tiller has still not become the
owner and the mundkar has not become the owner of his or her ancestral
house. While debating the Tenancy bill in 1964, Vijay Kamulkar, the
MGP MLA who defeated two mighty landlords Raoraje Deshprabhu and
Sadashiv Desai, had predicted this. He had urged the government to set
up a council to monitor the implementation of the act. Otherwise the
landlords would keep approaching the civil courts to stall its
implementation, he had cautioned.

Everything was going smooth as long as the tenant was paying a fixed
Khand of one sixth of the produce to the bhatkar. But the landlords
bounced back the minute the fifth amendment to the Agricultural
Tenancy Act was passed in the Assembly in 1976. Five petitions were
filed before the Judicial Commissioner by the Bhatkars, challenging
its constitutional validity. The government had deleted Chapter III
from the Act, which was permitting landlords to resume the land for
personal cultivation, with a ceiling. Instead, Chapter IIA was
inserted. Its section 18A permitted transfer of land to the
cultivating tenant for a price to be paid to the landlord. Landlords
feared that a tenant cultivating lands under different landlords may
have far larger areas of land than his landlord. On 4 April 1979, the
Judicial Commissioner struck down the amended act, terming it
unconstitutional and not constituting agrarian reform.

The Shashikala government swiftly moved to the Supreme Court,
challenging the judgement of the Judicial Commissioner.  Her
government was pushed into trouble by two young rebels − Dayanand
Narvekar and Dilkhush Desai. Despite that she managed to survive a
no-trust motion with the help of two independents from Daman and
Diu. But then her own minister Shankar Laad quit the ministry, pushing
her government once again into a minority. Laad was offered the Chief
Minister’s seat by the Leader of the Opposition and architect of the
rebellion Anant Narasimh alias Babu Naik, the Congressman belonging to
the landlord community. Shashikala-tai succeeded in getting
President’s Rule imposed by convincing the then Janata Party Prime
Minister Morarji Desai. The opposition did not succeed in forming an
alternate government, but the MGP government was out.

Simultaneously, Tai also managed to convince the Centre to move before
the Parliament an amendment to include the Agricultural Tenancy Act in
the ninth schedule of the Constitution. As per the provision, acts
included in the ninth schedule cannot be challenged in the courts of
law. Meanwhile, the Janata government collapsed, fresh elections were
held and Indira Gandhi’s Congress government came back to power. On 31
July 1983, the Centre moved the 47th amendment to the Constitution in
the Parliament. It included tenancy acts related to land reforms
enacted by the states of Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar
Pradesh and West Bengal as well as the union territory of Goa, Daman
and Diu. The amendment bill included both the acts of Goa, the
original Tenancy Act of 1964 as well as the fifth amendment
of 1976. The Statement of Objects and Reasons stated:

> “The various Acts which have been suggested for inclusion have been
> examined and it is proposed to include in the Ninth Schedule such of
> these Acts as have either been challenged or are likely to be
> challenged and thereby ensure that the implementation of these Acts is
> not adversely affected by litigation.”[^4]

The constitutional amendment was passed by the Parliament and it was
assented to by the President of India on 26 August 1984. The Goan
landlords challenged the inclusion of the fifth amendment in the ninth
schedule in the Supreme Court, which was also hearing Goa government’s
appeal against the high court order striking down the ninth
amendment. The landlords were defended by a phalanx of India’s eminent
lawyers including Fali Nariman, M N Phadke, S K Mehta and even Goa’s
topmost lawyer Manohar Usgaonkar.

Meanwhile, in the 1980 Assembly election, Congress rode to power with
an absolute majority and Pratapsingh Raoji Rane Sardesai, the Khashe
from Sattari, became the chief minister of Goa. He ruled the state for
10 long years uninterrupted. The case in the Supreme Court was moving
at a snail’s pace. Ravi Naik, the MGP MLA since 1984, also filed an
intervention application on behalf of his Akhil Gomantak Kull-Mundkar
Sanghatana to expedite the case, but all in vain. Rane became the CM
for the third consecutive term after the 1989 election, but his
government was toppled on 27 March 1990. The Progressive Democratic
Front, a coalition government of the Congress rebels and Ramakant
Khalap-led MGP, was formed.  The MGP leaders pursued the case in the
Supreme Court.

Within four months, on 23 July 1990, the apex court delivered the
judgement. It set aside the high court judgement and upheld the ninth
amendment bill.

> “The judgment of the Judicial Commissioner declaring the Act as ultra
> vires is accordingly set aside and the writ petitions filed by the
> respondents are dismissed. Consequently it is not necessary to deal
> with the writ petition (W.P. No. 864 of 1988) filed in this Court
> under Article 32 challenging the inclusion of the impugned Act in the
> 9th Schedule of the Constitution and the same is rejected.”[^5]

Meanwhile, the budget session of Goa Assembly was going on. Deputy CM
Ramakant Khalap suddenly entered the House in a dramatic manner and
made the announcement of the Supreme Court, calling it a historic
day. Agriculture Minister Ravi Naik distributed sweets to the
journalists in his cabin. Revenue Minister Dr Kashinath Jalmi moved
into action, authorising the Joint Mamlatdars to issue sanads to the
tenants after completing the formalities of purchasing the land.  But
lots of water had flown through the paddy fields in 30 years. The
rural population had slipped from 85 per cent in 1960 to 59 per cent
in 1990 due to large urbanisation.[^6]

1990 was also the year that had started showing a negative
growth in operational holdings in the agricultural sector. The
area under cultivation had reduced from 92,000 hectares in
1970 to 66,000 hectares in 1990, a decline of 15 per cent.[^7]

The 60 per cent workforce involved in agriculture in 1960 had declined
to 16 per cent. The contribution of agriculture to the Gross State
Domestic Product (GSDP) had dropped to just 10 per cent[^8] In my own
village of Loliem-Pollem in Canacona on the Goa-Karnataka border,
agriculture and allied activities had stopped completely, the lands
had fallen fallow, cowsheds had turned into garages and only our old
parents were left in our homes. We all had migrated to the towns for
our livelihoods.  The Economic Survey 2002 I am quoting here had also
pushed the chapter on ‘Agriculture & Allied Services’ to the second
last position, before ‘Other Sectors’:

> “The declining interest towards agriculture may be attributable to
> small land holdings, high cost of wages and nonavailability of
> agriculture labourers. In addition to this, increasing urbanisation
> has exerted pressure on land making the agriculture activity
> economically less viable on relative terms. On the other hand Goa
> being a major tourist destination attracting over 1.3 million tourists
> every year, which is equivalent to the population of the state, there
> is a tremendous scope for high value added crops like horticulture,
> floriculture, medicinal plants, vegetables etc.”

But rather than meeting this scope by diverting the agro economy of
Goa to cash crops, the politicians preferred to meet the growing
demand of land for housing for the outsiders and hotels including
large five-star resorts for the tourists. Converting agricultural land
into commercial became the prime ‘business’ of politicians. The
Assembly elected in 1990 witnessed a spurt of defections, topplings,
seven chief ministers in five years and the Town and Country Planning
Department − which converts the land − becoming the most lucrative
portfolio. The Planning and Development Authorities (PDAs), which
prepare the Outline Development Plans (ODPs), became the battlegrounds
for cronies of politicians to grab ‘commissions’. Ravi Naik, the
one-time president of the Tenants and Mundkars Association, himself
became one of the prime ‘broker-politicians’ of Goa.

There were varied modus operandis followed to convert the agricultural
land. The fifth amendment had widened the scope of tenanted land from
paddy and arecanut to horticulture, cashew cultivation and coconut
garden too. The tenant was considered the deemed purchaser and he had
no right to transfer the land even by way of lease. Once the property
was purchased under tenancy, the same could not be leased, mortgaged,
or sold nor could it be converted to non-agricultural use without the
permission of the Mamlatdar. It could be taken and given to another
person, but only to cultivate, through the Mamlatdar.  However, the
landlord could sell his property if his land was not tenanted. Giving
this background, Dr Nagesh Colvalkar, the Assistant Professor of V M
Salgaocar College of Law, states:

> “After 1975, landlords and builders filed several litigations based on
> Survey Records and Land Revenue Code claiming the ownership
> right. Litigations between tenants and landlords became more
> cumbersome due to non-preparation of Record of Rights, having no
> receipt of payment of rent to the Landlord with the Tenant and
> contract of lease. Under the Goa Agricultural Tenancy Act 1964 to
> claim tenancy right, the Tenant had to prove (a) possession of the
> land (b) Personal cultivation (c) Existence of lease (d) Payment of
> rent.”[^9]

There was also a spurt of complaints recorded at police stations, that
tenants and mundkars were forcibly evicted from the land, allegedly at
the behest of builders and with the blessings of politicians. Some of
the ‘eviction experts’ also entered active politics. However, many
builders followed a path of amicable settlements with the tenants or
mundkars by providing them flats and shops in the buildings. And in
many cases, yet another method was followed, called ‘negative
declaration’ by the tenants. It means that the tenant swears in front
of the Mamlatdar that his name has been wrongly entered as a tenant in
the I & XIV form of Land Records and withdraws from the land, in
collusion with the builder and the landlord.  In fact, this has now
become a legal practice from the time the Supreme Court has upheld the
order of Pernem Mamlatdar accepting negative declarations of the
tenants. The Bombay High Court at Goa, in this case, had earlier
struck down the Mamlatdar’s order of negative declaration, issued on
28 October 1986. This case was related to the controversial Golf
Course project at Terekhol, where half of the tenants had withdrawn as
tenants from the disputed property. Apparently, it was “amicably
settled” while the villagers as well as the social activists were up
in arms against the golf course project.[^10]

From the time this judgement has been delivered by the Honourable
Supreme Court, says young activist lawyer from Pernem Adv Prasad
Shapurkar, hundreds and thousands of negative declarations have been
given by the tenants with ‘free will’, in collusion with the landlord
and the builder. But he is equally proud of the remaining half of the
tenants of the Terekhol property, who did not bow down before the
pressure from the golf course promoters, including the local
politicians and the brokers. He is equally worried about the genuine
tenants whose cases are simply dragging on in the courts of Mamlatdars
for various reasons.

## THE ‘SUNSET’ OF THE BJP

And why are the cases dragging on for so long despite having set up so
many courts of Mamlatdars, Joint Mamlatdars and Deputy Collectors?
Salcete has eight courts and still over 600 cases of tenants and
mundkars are pending while little more than 200 have been settled in
10 years. (See table on Pg 317). Margao MLA Digambar Kamat recently
asked in the Assembly why the cases could not be expedited. And this
is what the government officially told him:

> “Courts of Mamlatdar & Deputy Collector are also handling election
> matters, other duties such as Law & Order, cases under various other
> Acts. There is less support staff in each court. The Government has
> initiated a Court Case Monitoring System which will help the
> government to monitor the progress of all the cases online. The
> process for recruiting additional staff is also in progress. Training
> has been given to the officers on the procedural aspects of hearing
> the matters. Idea of Saturday Courts have started taking up Tenancy
> and Mundkar cases.”[^11]

Interestingly, the joint mamlatdars were initially assigned to
exclusively handle the cases of tenants and mundkars. Each taluka
today has more than one or two Joint Mamlatdars. But apparently it has
not remained a priority for any government headed by any political
party, since 1990. In fact, the reply given by the Government to the
Assembly question raised by MLA Aleixo Reginald Lourenco in 2014
reflects the apathy at the level of the Mamlatdar. One case of
Constantino Pinto in Bardez has been dragging since 1972, and of
Gurudas Talkar in Pernem since 1976 and Gurudas Ghatwal and others in
Bicholim since 1983![^12]

The politicians holding the reins of governance are no less
irresponsible. Digambar Kamat, who raised the issue of dragging
tenancy cases in 2018, was the chief minister for five long years
from 2007. During his tenure, the Law Commission was headed by Adv
Ramakant Khalap and assisted by Adv Mario Pinto Almeida and Adv
Cleofato Coutinho. In 2009, the Commission framed a draft bill to set
up exclusive revenue courts to deal with tenancy and mundkar cases,
stating that the framers of the Constitution of India have adopted the
principle of separation of Judiciary from Executive:

> “The Commission is of the view that the judiciary work of Mamlatdars
> and Collectors must be separated from other routine work so that they
> can exclusively function as Courts and complete the judicial work
> before them expeditiously and without any interference. The Commission
> is of the opinion that a hierarchy of Revenue Courts can be created by
> establishing Taluka Revenue Courts with original jurisdiction and
> District Revenue Courts with appellate and revisional jurisdiction. We
> are also of the view that these courts should function under the
> overall supervision of the Administrative Tribunal.”[^13]

Despite being in power till 2012, the Kamat government did not pay
heed to this most crucial legislation. Those were the days when
illegal mining was at its peak. As though this apathy was not enough,
the next Law Commission set up under the chief ministership of Manohar
Parrikar and headed by Adv Narendra Sawaikar proposed in August 2013
an alternative to the exclusive revenue courts, which finally
boomeranged on the BJP government. By that time, the cases had piled
up to over 3000, with Bardez topping the list with 846 cases.

> “...we are conscious that the said Commission (headed by Khalap)
> proposed ‘The Goa Revenue Courts Bill 2009’ in their Report no. 3
> providing for a separate hierarchy of revenue officers solely to
> discharge judicial work under different laws.  What this Commission
> proposes is to recommend amendment to the Goa Agricultural Tenancy Act
> and to give the core adjudicatory functions under the said Act which
> are presently given to the ‘Mamlatdars’ under the said Act to the
> courts of the Civil Judges appointed under the Goa Civil Courts Act
> designated as ‘Civil Judges’ and provide for a single Appellate
> authority which would be ‘Appellate Judge’ meaning the District Judges
> including all the Additional District Judges appointed under the Goa
> Civil Courts Act. Appellate Judges shall also exercise revisional
> jurisdiction over the proceedings before the Civil Judges. This
> Commission is of the considered opinion that utilisation of the Judges
> of the existing civil courts in the matter of tenancy declaration
> cases and determination of tenancy issues arising in civil suits and
> other proceedings should go a long way in expediting the
> decision-making in tenancy matters.”[^14]

By the time these amendment bills to the Tenancy and Mundkar Acts were
passed on 21 August 2014, the pending tenancy cases had risen to 5000
and 2800 Mundkar cases.  Besides transferring the cases to the civil
courts, it had also proposed a system of contract farming as well as a
‘sunset clause’, setting a deadline of three years to file
applications by tenants and mundkars before the Mamlatdar for the
ownership of the land. The bill had initially set up the limit of only
one year.  BJP legislator Dr Pramod Sawant moved only one amendment to
change it to three years, and both the bills were passed ‘unanimously’
by all the 40 legislators without much debate.[^15]

But there was an uproar all across Goa over the ‘sunset clause’ as
well as transferring the cases to the civil courts.  Revenue Minister
Francisco D’Souza defended the legislation, claiming that “*civil
courts are better places for the disposal of cases simply because
judges are trained. On the other hand, mamlatdars are not so trained
because most of them are promotees from ‘awal karkuns’ to
mamlatdars. They do not have a legal background. They manage, but
progress is very slow.*”

There were allegations and counter-allegations, while demanding
withdrawal of the bill. Reiterating his demand for special revenue
courts to deal with the tenancy and mundkar cases, Congress leader
Ramakant Khalap alleged: “*The legislation would develop a nexus
between landowners and the real estate lobby to finish off the
remaining agricultural land in Goa. Even though most of our
agricultural land has already been bought by outsiders, now ‘upcoming
moneybags’ will exploit the contract farming section of the amended
act to eat up the remaining agricultural land in Goa.*”

Laxmikant Parsekar, who by then had taken over as the CM with Parrikar
becoming the defence minister of India, made a similar allegation,
claiming that the opposition was politically motivated by the land
sharks: “*The amendments to the Goa Tenancy Act seek to get rid of
land grabbers who survive on the discord between the land owner and
the tenant. The same landgrabbers and politically motivated leaders
are now misleading the people, provoking them against the
amendment…. If a tenant fails to file the claim within three years,
the state government can grant more time in some cases.*”[^16]

Both sides were blaming each other, but were in agreement that the
land sharks were looting Goa’s prime cultivable land!  The BJP
government remained adamant and transferred all the cases to the civil
courts. Amidst the uproar came the 2017 Assembly election. In spite of
introducing a series of social schemes for the cross-section of the
society, building good infrastructure, and Parrikar holding one of the
highest positions, of defence minister at the Centre, the BJP slipped
down from 21 to 13 seats. The Congress, despite doing nothing but
fighting among themselves and some of its ‘loyal soldiers’ hobnobbing
with the Hindutva party, rose from nine to 17 and emerged as the
largest single party in a hung Assembly. BJP supremo Amit Shah and
influential union minister Nitin Gadkari moved into action and
‘managed’ to lift the anti-BJP regional outfits like the MGP and Goa
Forward Party as well as the independents into the saffron camp to
form its own government on 14 March 2017.

Apparently, the BJP had learnt a lesson. After reviewing the election
results and the unexpected shocking debacle of the BJP, revenue
minister Francisco D’Souza announced that the government would
withdraw the controversial amendments of the tenancy and mundkar acts,
including the sunset clause, and cases would be reverted back to the
mamlatdars. He admitted that the decision was being taken in view of
the strong criticism from the opposition and the tenants’
associations. He also assured to expedite the pending tenancy cases
within three years. (Even after four years, over 3500 cases are still
pending).  Accordingly, the new amendments were moved in the third
session of the Assembly in August 2017 to drop the controversial
clauses. Revenue Minister Rohan Khaunte said roughly about 3900 cases
(out of 4000 transferred to civil courts) would be transferred back to
the mamlatdars. When the ruling party legislator Nilesh Cabral asked
him if moving the cases to civil courts was detrimental to the
tenants, Khaunte said: “*.. the rate of cases going in favour of the
landlords and against the tenants remained almost the same, with it
being 21 per cent when it was with the Mamlatdars and 23 per cent when
it was with the civil courts.*”

The most interesting statement came from BJP’s own Sports Minister
Babu Azgaonkar, who is known for his bold and blunt talk. “The BJP
government’s decision to move the cases from the mamlatdar courts to
the senior civil judge had backfired on the BJP and it was the reason
why the Congress managed to win so many seats in the election. If
there is anyone who has been embarrassed by this amendment, it is the
BJP.”[^17]

## Dealers Become Leaders

Dr Nagesh Colvalkar, concludes his research paper on
Land Reforms in Goa, by aptly focussing upon the unholy nexus
between the land sharks, politicians, and bureaucrats:

> “...in Goa today, the scenario is totally adverse against land reform
> laws. Cultivators purchase the land under tenancy law which must be
> exclusively used for agricultural purpose, but these tenants in
> reality sell the tenanted lands to the big builders and estate
> developers for carrying out construction activity in violation of the
> provisions of the Goa Agricultural Tenancy Act under the blessing of
> political leaders, land mafias and bureaucrats. This needs to be
> stopped at all cost, failing which land reforms in Goa will be a
> futile exercise without any gain to the state of Goa.”

Earlier in the ‘60s and the ‘70s, politics was a ‘Mission’, for which
freedom fighters, social reformers, teachers etc.  were entering the
political arena. By the ‘80s, politics slowly began to turn into a
‘Profession’ and full-time politicians began to mushroom. This also
led to a rise in corruption. But since the 1990s, it has now
completely turned into a business of ‘Commission’. Earlier political
parties were collecting funds from the lobbies of mine owners,
contractors, private bus owners, trawler owners, industrialists,
hoteliers etc. and the governments were serving the interest of their
lobbies, at the cost of suppressing the welfare of the toiling
masses. This also led to a series of public agitations by farmers,
workers, toddy tappers, traditional fishermen like ramponkars,
students, women, etc. But nowadays, representatives of the business
lobbies have personally entered into active politics, posing as
‘social workers’ by donating generously for sports tournaments,
cultural extravaganzas, and other public causes.

These included a few landowners initially, but then came the private
bus operators, trawler owners, contractors, hoteliers, and even mine
owners. But now the Assembly is overflowing with the ‘social workers’
who are dealers of land, including builders, real estate developers,
and even land brokers. The latest trend among these
‘broker-politicians’ is to get tickets for their brothers, wives and
daughters so that they can increase their stake in power
sharing. Perhaps this is the reason the cases of land grabbing,
illegal land conversions, and encroachments of cultivable land are not
topping the agendas of the Assembly debates. And the controversial
amendments like 16B to the Town and Country Planning Act are passed
smoothly.

We have six political leaders in the House, who are legally involved
in construction business: Luizinho Faleiro, Ravi Naik, Digambar Kamat,
Pandurang Madkaikar, Rohan Khaunte, and Tony Fernandes. The real
estate developers like Babush Monserrate, Vijai Sardesai, and Nilesh
Cabral have also entered the Assembly. People in political circles
reveal that heavyweight politicians like Vishwajeet Rane, Dr Pramod
Sawant, Isidore Fernandes etc. are known to be property brokers.  In
fact, before joining active politics, Dr Sawant was a land broker and
is widely known till date in Sattari and Bicholim as ‘Property
Sawant’. There was also a land dealing case in Canacona, which was
widely reported since a sitting judge was expelled from the
service. Junior Rane was allegedly involved in the land dealing. There
is obviously nothing wrong with the land dealings since these are all
legal businesses. But it is also a fact that illegalities in land
conversions and land grabbing have become the order of the day with
the entry of more and more land-dealing businessmen into the Goa
Assembly. Today, in talukas like Pernem, where the tenants had once
defeated mighty landlords of Goa, the prominent leaders contesting
elections are the builders, real estate dealers, and brokers.

The trend of Family Raj in politics coincides with the increasing
trend of converting agricultural land into settlement and selling it
to land sharks, which began in the last decade of the 20th
century. With the advent of the 21st century began the era of Family
Raj politics. Otherwise, it was only Bhausaheb Bandodkar who had
brought his daughter Shashikala into active politics or Dr Jack
Sequeira fielding his son Erasmo to become the South Goa MP, in the
1960s and ‘70s respectively.  During the tenure of Digambar Kamat,
Vishwajit Rane was the minister while his father Pratapsingh Rane was
the Speaker.

(Kindly Note: Elected candidates are shown in **bold**)

Similarly, the brother duo Churchill and Joaquim Alemao were holding
the influential portfolios of PWD and Urban Development in the same
ministry. In the Manohar Parrikar-led government from 2012, another
brother duo Sudin and Dipak Dhavalikar were ministers with important
portfolios like PWD, Transport, Cooperation etc. And in the subsequent
government of Dr Pramod Sawant after Parrikar’s demise, Jennifer
Monserrate is the revenue minister while her husband Babush is the
chairman of the Panaji Planning and Development Authority (PPDA).

The tradition continues with nine duos within the families planning to
contest the 2022 Assembly election. In fact some of them are
negotiating with more than one political party and even jumping out
from one party to another to bargain for their joint tickets. These
are husband Babush and wife Jennifer Monserrate, brothers Sudin and
Dipak Dhavalikar, husband Babu and wife Savitri Kavalekar, husband
Michael and wife Delilah, husband Vishwajit and wife Divya Rane,
husband Kiran and wife Kavita Kandolkar, father Ravi and son Ritesh
Naik, brothers Rohan and Rajesh Khaunte, as well as father Churchill
and daughter Valanka Alemao.

The dangers of this increasing trend of broker-politicians were
experienced by Goans through the most controversial Regional Plan Goa
2011, known as RPG-11, when Babush Monserrate was heading the town and
country planning ministry in 2006 in the Congress government led by
Pratapsingh Rane.  Though the legislators were dormant to the plan,
the alert Niz Goenkars rose against it, led a state-wide historic
agitation under the banner of the Goa Bachao Abhiyan and got the
destructive RPG11 scrapped. In 2007, Digambar Kamat took over as the
new Congress CM, and formed a Task Force of nationally reputed Goa
architects and town planners under the chairmanship of internationally
renowned architect Charles Correa. They later also framed a new RPG21,
banning conversion of cultivable land and laying down guidelines for
restricted construction activity by demarcating Economically Sensitive
Zones as well as restricted Zones for village panchayats.

Even after this, the cases against violation of the RPG21 guidelines
are piling up in the courts of law. In fact the major case the High
Court of Bombay at Goa is hearing since 2018 is the controversial
amendment passed by the Assembly on 30 July 2018. It was moved by then
TCP Minister Vijai Sardesai, in the coalition government headed by
Manohar Parrikar. A new section 16B was inserted in the TCP Act:

> “16B. Change of zone in Regional Plan.— 
>
> (1) If at any time, after the Regional Plan comes into operation, the
> Chief Town Planner (Planning) receives a written request from any
> person for change of zone of his land in the Regional Plan, he shall,
> after carrying out such fresh surveys and examination of the matter as
> may be considered necessary, submit his report to the Board and the
> Government, along with plan showing details about change of zone in
> the Regional Plan…
>
> (4) After the Regional Plan comes into operation, the Chief Town
> Planner (Planning) may, with the prior approval of the Government,
> make such changes in such Regional Plan as may be necessary for
> correcting any typographical or cartographical errors, omissions or
> details of proposals not fully indicated or changes arising out of the
> implementation of the proposals in the Regional Plan: Provided that
> all such changes are in the public interest and are notified to the
> public.”

Once again there was a public uproar, alleging that the hidden agenda
of 16B was to change the agricultural zone to settlement and grant
permissions for massive new commercial projects. TCP Minister Vijai
Sardesai justified it, claiming that it would be done on a
case-to-case basis and only in cases of public interest. Goa Congress
President Girish Chodankar countered it, alleging that it would be on
suitcase-to-suitcase basis. Finally, the Goa Bachao Abhiyan and others
challenged the controversial amendment bill in the high court in
November 2018. The hearing was not complete till December 2021.
Meanwhile, the high court allowed the government to consider the
proposals of changing the zones but no approval could be granted till
the case is decided. The high court in its interim directive stated:

> “In the meantime, we direct that any action that may be taken in
> pursuance of Section 16B of the Goa Town and Country Planning Act,
> 1974, shall be subject to the outcome of the present petition. This
> position is made clear so that no parties can claim any
> equities.”[^18]

Accordingly, the TCP Board started entertaining applications for land
conversions under Section 16B, processing it and even granting
‘provisional approvals’, pending the court directive. Since the
hearing also got delayed due to the Covid19 pandemic, the GBA lawyer
Adv Norma Alvares requested the court to restrain the TCP from
considering further applications.

After hearing both the sides, the high court observed: “*Taking into
consideration the fact that no final approvals have been granted
relying upon the impugned provision or the fact that it is not likely
that even provisional approvals are likely to be granted upon the
fresh proposals received for at least the next two months, we make no
further orders on the request of Ms. Alvares.*”[^19]

Was it an error committed by the court in allowing the government to
process the applications for land conversions under section 16B? Or
was it a deliberate move by the learned judges to verify what kind of
applications are received, from whom, for what purpose and who are the
people willing to convert their cultivable land? Whatever may be the
intention, the applications received by the TCP were an eye opener.

## Over 2 Crore Square Metres?

After passing this controversial amendment of 16B in July 2018, two
leading politicians held the town and country planning
portfolios. Vijai Sardesai for one year, till July 2019, and from then
till fresh elections, Babu Kavlekar. In reply to the question asked by
Leader of the Opposition Digambar Kamat, Kavlekar told the Assembly in
February 2020 that 5601 applications have been received for converting
cultivable zones into settlement. Due to the assurance given to the
High Court, no applications have been processed after November
2019.[^20]

The Assembly records show that applications for zone conversions have
come from all across Goa and all the 12 talukas. In fact, more
applications have come from the villages than the cities, with a
maximum applied for settlement zones.  The lands are also paddy
fields, orchards, natural cover, under irrigation command area, and
even within the coastal regulation zones. They are either for housing
colonies or hotels and resorts. Hardly any proposals are for public
institutions, in ‘public interest’.

The next table shows taluka-wise conversion applications placed before
the TCP Board when Vijai Sardesai was the TCP minister till July 2019.

All these 5531 applications were processed and were in different
phases of scrutiny, involving over 1.91 crore square metres of
cultivable land. Topping the list is Pernem taluka with nearly 40 lakh
square metres of cultivable land and then comes Bardez with around 36
lakh square metres of land. Both are tourism zones. The maximum land
in Pernem taluka proposed to be converted is in Mandrem
constituency. Likewise with the coastal belt of Bardez taluka. Half of
the land sought to be converted lies in the three talukas of Pernem,
Bardez and Ponda, involving nearly 98 lakh square metres of cultivable
land. More than half of the applications are also from these three
talukas.  The zone conversion applications received in Mandrem
constituency of Pernem taluka, within a six months period of December
2018 to May 2019, under 16B, numbered 373. The land proposed to be
converted is around 33.88 lakh square metres. The major chunk of it,
around 21 lakh square metres, is owned by J M Township Real Estates
Pvt Ltd, a Mumbai-based real estate company, which has tied up with a
local company running a casino in Goa.

Interestingly, Vijai Sardesai asked a question in the Assembly after
he was dropped from the cabinet and was forced to sit in the
opposition, to know how many more people have applied for land
conversion during the tenure of his successor Babu Kavlekar. This
table is being compiled, based on the Assembly reply.

These tables are not foolproof. TCP Minister Kavlekar, in a reply to
another question asked by his predecessor Vijai Sardesai, told the
Assembly that a total 878 provisional approvals have been given by the
TCP Board from April 2017, when the Parrikar government was
formed.[^21] Out of these, I could trace records of only 148
applications approved, 29 during Sardesai’s tenure and 119 during
Kavlekar’s. Barely 14 per cent of the applications. But that itself
reveals that over 26 lakhs square metres of cultivable land have been
provisionally approved to be converted. The figures of 730 more
applications are still unknown.

Also in the pipeline at various stages are a total of 5670
applications. What it means in simple terms is that if proposals
received during the whole tenure of the BJP governments led by Manohar
Parrikar and Dr Pramod Sawant are counted and if the high court gives
a green signal to the controversial clause of 16B, then Goa would lose
forever the cultivable land of two crore and twenty five lakh square
metres!

While browsing through the list of applications available in the
Assembly replies, I could trace some applications made by our own
lawmakers, present and former, who had ‘unanimously supported’ the
Regional Plan 2021. The RPG21 clearly stated that no zone changing
would be allowed for the next 10 years, especially for settlement
purposes. This table lists out applications made by present and former
MLAs, to convert zones from paddy fields, natural cover, private
forest, land under irrigation command area, and even no development
zone. The table is self-explanatory.

## Three-Fourth Illegal Tourism

After mining, tourism has been the economic backbone of Goa. It is
flourishing day by day, not only as an international tourist
destination but the most favoured destination of Corporate India and
its executive class. However, its focus on beach tourism combined with
vice tourism has resulted in the promotion of all kinds of immoral
activities including prostitution, gambling, and consumption of
drugs. Politicians have been accusing each other of protecting the
underworld mafias and patronising the vice tourism. The coastland,
predominantly located in the Old Conquests and also in parts of Pernem
and Canacona, has thus become a hotspot of all kinds of illegalities
and abuse of land.

Under the full protection of Goa’s political class, tourism all along
the coast was ‘developed’ by mercilessly cutting all the protective
sand dunes and the coastal vegetation to construct hotels and star
resorts. Due to this mindless destruction of the coastland, Goa’s
beaches are today facing sand erosion while Goa has not escaped from
the worldwide phenomenon of rising sea levels. Similar is the fate of
our six prime rivers. In order to control the future devastation of
the coastal belt and protect the coastal ecology, the Government of
India issued a Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) in 1991 under the
Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. It was further amended from time
to time since new loopholes were found which were arrested by the
courts.

> “In most of these areas, an area of 200 metres from the High Tide Line
> (HTL) has been declared as a no development zone. Several restrictions
> have been imposed for carrying out the development in the area between
> 200 to 500 metres from HTL. These measures have been adopted to
> protect the fragile ecosystem, which exists in the said area and which
> is vital to sustain ecological balance.”[^22]

Accordingly the Coastal Regulation Zones were divided into categories,
like CRZ I, where no new constructions shall be permitted; CRZ II,
where buildings shall be permitted only in the landward side of the
existing road and no permission for construction of buildings on
landward side of new roads; CRZ III is the area where up to 200 metres
from the HTL is earmarked as ‘No Development Zone’.

> “Goa Coast Line remained pristine till early 1970s. Human pressure on
> the coastal ecosystem started in the 1970s when tourism became a major
> source of revenue. This resulted in 80% of the urban growth being
> located along the coastal talukas.  There has been a proliferation of

> beach side bars, roads and beach shacks along the coast. This has
> resulted in dense population, deterioration of the quality of life,
> loss of biodiversity and adverse effects on beaches, dunes, mangroves,
> water bodies and ‘Khazan lands’ – (reclaimed lowlands).
>

> water ingress.”[^23]

The Remote Sensing Survey Instruments of Hyderabad conducted an
extensive survey in 2006 of the whole Goan coastline as well as the
river line with the help of satellite data of 1991 and 2005, aerial
photographs of 1993 as well as the actual physical survey including
the field survey. These were the findings of the structures that have
come up in violation of the CRZ guidelines all along the Goan coast as
well as on the banks of six rivers of Goa.

Bardez tops the list with a maximum number of 1585 new structures that
have come up in 15 years, that too only in three villages: Calangute:
685, Candolim: 620 and Anjuna: 280.  Comparatively, though Salcete
taluka is second on the list with 802 structures, it comprises nine
villages. Maximum among them are Cavelossim with 330 structures, 250
in Varca, 215 in Colva and 199 in Benaulim. Also in Mormugao, the
third taluka of the Old Conquests, there were 569 new structures found
in eight villages. Maximum among them are the 128 structures in
Velsao. But the survey report does not mention how big the structures
are. Goa’s top star hotels are located in the coastal belt of these
three talukas.

The spread of structures within the CRZ is also found in three talukas
and 11 villages of Pernem, Canacona and Quepem. Quitol in Quepem did
not have a single structure till 1991, but 11 new structures came up
in the CRZ in 15 years.  Though tourism is spreading more widely in
Pernem in four villages, and Palolem village alone in Canacona
surpasses all the other villages of the New Conquests. It has 777 new
structures including one seven star resort out of a total 781. Next in
line is Arambol in Pernem taluka with 628 structures, 409 in Morjim,
203 in Mandrem, and 145 in Querim. Agonda in Canacona is rising with
365 structures and 320 in Cola. And it is not only on the
beachside. Riverside tourism is also increasing rapidly. The CRZ
violations were also found increasing even on the banks of six major
rivers of Goa.

However, if this table is analysed by taking the average number of
structures that have come up in each village (see the last column of
the table), then we find that more structures are coming up along the
Talpona river of Canacona, which has only four villages. It means the
illegalities committed in the tourism belt are now witnessed not only
on the coastland but also the midland.

The trend in the last 15 years also seems to be similar, with
illegalities in terms of CRZ violations found to be more rampant in
the three talukas of the New Conquests, along with the Old
Conquests. No data is available in this regard, but the cases of CRZ
violation in the High Court of Bombay at Goa as well as the National
Green Tribunal are mounting day by day while the politicians are
openly accusing the Green activists, especially the Goa Foundation,
for “*creating obstacles in developing Goa.*” Dr Claude Alvares and
his activist lawyer wife Adv Norma Alvares have become number one
enemies of the Goa Assembly, across the party lines.

Growing through this in Goa is illegal tourism, just like illegal
mining. The issue was first raised by Serafino Cota, a hotelier from
Carmona and the president of Goa Small and Medium Hotel Owners’
Association. He succeeded in convincing the influential Travel and
Tourism Association of Goa about this hidden truth. I once brought
both these tourism bodies as well as top officials of Goa Tourism
Development Corporation and Tourism Department together for a TV
debate.

The revelations were quite shocking.

TTAG President Savio Messias alleged that 60 per cent of hotels and
other structures accommodating tourists in Goa are not
registered. While only 600 hotels are registered in the A and B
categories, the actual number is 3000! Cota added to this, claiming
that the total number of illegal rooms is over 10,000.  And the entire
racket of illegal tourism runs under the nose of the tourism
authorities through online booking.

Cota explained the simplest modus operandi of illegal tourism. First a
hotelier builds a small resort with around 10 rooms, which is
registered. But the online booking is made for 20, 30, or even 100
rooms sometimes, which are the holiday homes built adjacent to the
registered resort. The second method is that online booking companies
are holding the keys of these holiday homes and even flats, mostly
purchased by the outsiders. In both the cases, accommodations are
provided at much cheaper rates than the official room tariff since
they don’t need to pay any kind of fees or taxes to the
government. While admitting the fact that the growth in the number of
tourists is 10 to 12 per cent in road, rail and air traffic, the GTDC
official informed that 10 to 12 new hotels are registered in Goa every
week.

Soon came the Covid19 pandemic and Pandora’s Box was opened. Chief
Minister Dr Pramod Sawant, in the official cabinet note of 8 April
2020, stated that “*the authorities have identified 589 foreign
tourists stranded in the registered hotels and guest houses. This
number excludes the tourists staying in un-registered hotels, guest
houses etc. However, as per the data available with the FRRO, it is
estimated that more than 2500 foreigners alone were stranded.*”

It meant that the government was fully aware of the unregistered
hotels and other kinds of accommodations, which were run with
political patronage and bureaucratic protection.  But the actual
number of foreign tourists was much beyond even the estimates worked
out by the FRRO. The last official report of 24 May 2020 available
stated that a total 7774 foreign tourists left Goa in 39 special
flights arranged by the companies who booked them online.[^25] And
only 589 among them were found in registered hotels.

What it meant is that 12 times more number of foreign tourists were
living in Goa, that too at the fag end of the tourism season, from
February onwards. This number does not include the domestic
tourists. Officially, in 2018-19, Goa received a total 79.38 lakhs of
tourists, out of which 70.08 lakhs were domestic tourists (88%) and
9.30 lakhs were foreigners (12%).[^26] It also meant that when we had
7774 foreign tourists in Goa, there were 57,000 domestic tourists
here. And with the same calculation if we go further and calculate
79.38 lakh tourists, then the total number of tourists goes above nine
crores! Maybe this is an exaggeration since we don’t know how many
domestic and foreign tourists live in the unregistered hotels,
guesthouses, etc.

But finally the cat was out of the bag. The tourism department took a
serious note of this revelation. As the tourism industry was the worst
hit due to the pandemic, the authorities pulled up their sleeves and
prepared an excellent document on “*Survival and Revival of Goa’s
Tourism Industry,*” a survey carried out by the Goa Tourism
department. It was conducted, analysed, and concluded with firm and
stern proposals. The report also estimates the actual tourist footfall
at 1.5 crores.  Almost 71 lakhs of illegal tourists!

The TTAG and Small Hoteliers’ Association were alleging that 60 per
cent of hotels etc. are illegal. But here is the official report which
estimates that 76 per cent are illegal. The report has also suggested
an Action Plan, in terms of action to be taken by the Government of
Goa. Regarding the unregistered illegal units, it has suggested that a
circular be issued by the Department of Tourism to register within 30
days, failing which a penal action would be taken.

The illegal tourism is a direct reply to the question of why so many
hotels, resorts, villas, holiday homes, real estate projects and
colonies are proposed to be set up by applying under 16b of the TCP
Act in the no-development zones earmarked by the Regional
Plan 2021. The GTDC report also proposes development of hinterland
tourism while there are also hundreds of proposals for conversion of
cultivable land into settlement zones. In fact these proposals also
include some big private firms and companies listing out thousands of
square metres of land for conversion. Though the GTDC report is one of
the best documents ever produced on how to develop Goa’s tourism, it
raises eyebrows regarding some proposals, on the lines of the
controversial clause of 16B in the TCP Act. The GTDC report talks
about land parcels:

> Provision of land parcel for increased tenure: Getting land parcels
> for commercial development can be challenging in Goa’s hinterland, as
> most of the area is under forest cover or under no development
> zone. Also, in order to maintain a balance between the ecology of the

## MIND ‘OUR’ MINES

The Second World War was a blessing in disguise for Portuguese
Goa. Mining took off as an industry when Japan started importing Goa’s
iron ore from 1950 onwards. The mine owners were the wealthiest class
of Goa, who were fully backing the Portuguese government during the
whole liberation movement while some ‘nationalist’ mine owners were
also secretly supporting the freedom fighters. Also in independent
Goa, from the first election of 1963 till date, the ‘mine owners’ is
the most powerful lobby that has been controlling Goan politics and
almost all the major political parties, no matter whether they are
ruling or in the opposition. Goenchi Maati, the organisation floated
by Dr Claude Alvares of Goa Foundation, has described the whole
journey of Goa’s mining industry in a concise manner.

> “Reports of minerals in Goa date back very far. There are reports
> that Jains living in Cudnem used to extract Gold in Goa.  The
> existence of iron ore mines was known to the Portuguese from the early
> 1700s, but it was hushed up for fear of invasion by others. However,

Justice Shah Commission said it’s a scam of Rs 35,000 crore and
described it as a Theft, suggesting the people involved in the scam
are nothing but Thieves. It was a daylight robbery. With the China
boom, wheels had started moving in Goan politics while unabated mining
had begun. Goa’s leading miner and owner of Fomento, Auduth Timblo
personally took the initiative in 2004 to pull out three-time BJP MLA
Digambar Kamat from the Manohar Parrikar-led BJP government and
re-establish the Rane-led Congress government. Kamat continued to be
the mining minister. After the 2007 Assembly election, Kamat was made
the chief minister. Thanks to illegal mining and practically the whole
political class jumping at the opportunity of looting Goa’s treasure,
the Kamat-led Congress government completed the whole term without any
trouble from any political party.

At that moment, 117 mining leases were operational, covering 259
square kilometres of land of Goa. CM Kamat had set up a Task Force and
then the State Level Committee (SLC) under the chairmanship of
internationally renowned architect Charles Correa along with India’s
and Goa’s leading town planners, in order to prepare a new Regional
Plan 2021.  Besides mapping the cultivated land and marking zones for
housing, the SLC also marked areas to develop agriculture, tourism,
industry and even mining. It had also provided an Action Plan and how
to phase out mining by providing an alternative to the mining
dependent population. Perhaps for the first time, the areas of land of
mining were classified into the forest, private forest, orchard,
cultivated paddy fields, catchment area of water bodies, industrial
areas as well as settlement areas.

The ‘mine owners’ of Goa still claim that they are not the lease
holders but the owners of the mines since the Portuguese had given it
to them as perpetual concessions. They have challenged the Goa, Daman
and Diu Mining Concessions (Abolition and Declaration as Mining
Leases) Act, 1987. It is still lying in the Supreme Court.

By releasing a document regarding the types of land allotted for
mining leases, the SLC in 2010 had listed out the kind of damage
mining has caused in the midland and hinterland and brought it to the
notice of Kamat government.

> “Mining has caused incalculable direct and indirect damage to both
> the environment and the people in these areas - by affecting the
> quality of air, water and forests, as well as health, agriculture,
> employment and living conditions of the people. The major impacts are
> as under:
>
> 1. About 1110.81 hectares of forest land has been diverted to mining
>    as per the data furnished by the Forest Dept.
> 2. A number of mining leases are located in the catchment areas of
>    water bodies and in the case of Selaulim dam, even within the
>    buffer area of the dam. This threatens the quality and the holding
>    capacity of this primary water source which caters to the entire
>    South Goa district.
> 3. There are no controls on the depth of the mines. As a result mining
>    is done even below the water table at the cost of underground
>    aquifers, causing acute water shortage in mining areas (should be
>    brought under Goa Groundwater Regulation Act 2002).
> 4. Open ore transportation by trucks is causing severe air pollution
>    and disrupting the health and social lives of villagers in the
>    mining talukas.
> 5. Agriculture is severely affected in the areas around mines because
>    of siltation and lack of ground water for irrigation.
> 6. The siltation of the Zuari and Mandovi rivers is a direct result of
>    the mining activities occurring upstream along these rivers and the
>    failure of anti-erosion measures.
> 7. Barge building activity has been mushrooming all along the river
>    banks to keep up with the increase in mining activity.

The SLC had also made 26 recommendations for sustainable mining,
stating that action needs to be taken to minimise the brutal
environmental fall-outs of mining, and for deciding on options for the
future. Until this task is completed, the SLC had clearly suggested
that no new mines should be allowed to start (including those with
valid licences), nor should any new leases be considered.

These recommendations are nothing different from what the Supreme
Court has suggested to revive Goa’s mining. In fact the RPG21 had
tackled the issue in a more holistic manner while the Supreme Court
has limited its scope to have mining activity within a legal
framework. The RPG21 has even suggested an alternative economy for the
mining-dependent areas. If these recommendations were implemented
immediately after the plan was submitted to the government, Goa would
not have faced the blanket mining ban, due to which the associated
people are suffering for the last 10 years. But neither Digambar Kamat
during his remaining tenure nor Manohar Parrikar, who succeeded him
and faced the mining ban, bothered to implement it. The whole
political class, including the Communist Party of India and its AITUC
trade union leader Christopher Fonseca, took pride in holding Dr
Claude Alvares and his Goa Foundation responsible for the mining
ban. Rather than accusing the thieves, the one who caught the thieves
was blamed. These recommendations were made two years before even the
Goa Foundation had approached the Supreme Court, seeking a ban on
mining to put a stop to the madness of the whole political class in
destroying Goa.

Have a look at some of the crucial recommendations the Charles Correa
Committee had made:

1. Bring an immediate halt to mining and dumping outside delineated
   and mapped 117 working Mining Leases.
2. Terminating at earliest, from the 117 working mines, those mines
   which are located within 200 metres from existing settlement
   fences, 200 m from river banks, Wild Life Sanctuaries and National
   Parks and within their surrounding one km buffer zones, 500 metres
   around ASI and State protected monuments and two kms from the
   boundary of the Submergence Area for reservoirs of the State Water
   Supply system, like Selaulim, Anjunem etc.
3. Phase out, within the next three years, those mines that are
   located within 500 metres from the fence of settlement areas having
   a population of 100 persons, one km from the fence of settlement
   areas having a population of 500 persons and above, Catchment areas
   of Reservoirs of Selaulim and Anjunem and one km to two kms of the
   boundaries of the Wild Life Sanctuaries.
4. No area or number of existing 117 mines should increase till 2021.
5. Leases from among 117 that are in Eco- I zone and have not yet been
   mined should not be allowed to start operation.
6. Remaining non-operational 219 mining leases should not be allowed
   to start operation.
7. Restrict mining above the water table.
8. No new forest area to be diverted to mining since there is no land
   available in the State for compensatory afforestation.
9. No transportation of topsoil beyond the lease area should be
   allowed as per mining regulations.
10. In order to prevent malpractice, all mines must have all the
    necessary clearances under Environment Act, Air Act, Water Act,
    Forest Conservation Act, NOC from the National Board of Wildlife
    and Pollution Control Board as well as valid approval of mining
    lease from the government.
11. Utilise mining for solving the existing land filling material
    scarcity for public projects like roads etc.  This will help avoid
    unnecessary cutting of hills that is otherwise necessitated.
12. Rehabilitate all non-working/closed mines for water harvesting and
    restoring damaged water tables.
13. Make rehabilitation of farm land (Paddy Fields) an integral part
    of the Mining Policy. The owner should restore the land to its
    original use of forest, agriculture or orchard after the mine is
    exhausted.
14. Examine the options of replacing ore-transported general roads
    either by a much narrower (18m) road, or by a dedicated mining
    covered conveyor belt system from the mining areas to the jetties.
15. Construct a bypass road as a Growth corridor by 2021, which allows
    northbound and southbound traffic coming in from Belgaum to
    bifurcate and bypass Goa, which passes right through these
    devastated areas.
16. Build new growth centres along this belt which will also help take
    the pressure off the coastal belt, their development should be on
    a fast track, and a new planning and implementation cell created
    to identify the land needed (preferably wasteland).
17. Appoint a High Power Task Force to look at all the issues related
    to mining in the State and define a rational and long-term
    sustainable mining Policy for the State.

Neither any government nor the two subsequent Assemblies of 2012 and
2017 have even bothered to discuss this whole plan and its valuable
recommendations. If it was implemented, mining would have not been
banned by the Supreme Court, workers would have not been retrenched,
mining-dependents would have not starved and Goan economy would have
not been affected. But unfortunately Goa did not have a single
lawmaker elected who could alert the authorities. Who was responsible
for this most irresponsible attitude that led to the economic downfall
of Goa?

## RICH POLITICIANS AND POOR POLITICS

There was a time when only the Congress was considered to be a poor
party of rich politicians. But now it is across the board. Politics is
a shortcut to become filthy rich within no time.  This is a pan-India
phenomenon. Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power with a thumping
majority in 2014 by assuring the people of India that he would get
back the black money of corruption accumulated in India and the banks
abroad. His experiment of demonetisation to get the black money out of
bags, fight corruption, get rid of fake notes and contain terror
funding failed miserably. Withdrawing currency notes of 1000 and 500
denominations amounted to 86 per cent of India’s currency. Modi was
expecting that one third of Rs 15 lakh crore would not be returned to
the banks since it was ‘black’. But in reality, the Reserve Bank of
India announced that 99.3 per cent of currency notes were deposited.

It is not an easy task to prove which politician is corrupt and who is
not. There are different tactics used to hoodwink the income tax
authorities and accumulate black money. But even then total income
cannot be hidden. The Election Commission of India has now made it
compulsory for the candidates to file an affidavit where the legal
income needs to be shown. Since then, the Association of Democratic
Reforms (ADR), the NGO, has been keeping a watch on the contestants
and analysing their performance as well as their earnings, shown
legally. The table supplied by the ADR has analysed the income shown
by the contestants since 2007.

Unlike the common man or the normal businessmen, the income of
politicians is not only doubling in five years but raised by even over
900 per cent, like in case of two-time MLA and one-time minister Dipak
Dhavalikar. When these MLAs contested in 2017, the richest man among
them was twotime MLA Michael Lobo, representing Goa’s tourist hotspot,
Calangute. Pratapsingh Rane, the 11-time MLA and five-time chief
minister, is next in the line. Then comes Pandurang Madkaikar, who
travelled from the MGP to the Congress to the BJP; Babush and Jennifer
Monserrate, Vishwajit Rane and so on.  This has been a ‘rich journey’
of Goan politicians, till 2017.  The latest figures will be known when
they file nominations for the 2022 poll. (The ADR did not provide
figures of those MLAs who have expired, like Manohar Parrikar,
Francisco D’Souza and Vishnu Wagh).

In comparison, if we analyse the whole journey of Goan politics till
date, what we observe is mindless misuse of our land rather than
utilising it for the development of the people who cultivate this
land. No thought is given to sustainable and balanced development of
Goa that would not kill the villages and congest the cities. It is not
just mining or agriculture or tourism or industry, but the Politics of
Business and the Business of Politics that has ruined Goa by the
short-sighted political class of Goa. The vision of Bhausaheb
Bandodkar and Dr Jack de Sequeira has absolutely faded away.

For example, Goa’s urban population is today not less than 10
lakhs. We also receive 1.50 crores of tourists every year, meaning on
an average 12.50 lakh tourists every month. This whole lot of around
22 lakhs needs on a daily basis vegetables, rice, wheat, cereals,
fruits, flowers, milk, eggs, meat etc. Goa is certainly equipped
enough with the basic natural resources like land and water required
to produce these necessities. But the sad part of Goa’s ‘developing
economy’ is that the land available to cultivate it is either lying
idle, barren or is being converted every day for short-term monetary
gains. Instead, we import all these necessities from the neighbouring
states at a much higher cost, making our economy costly.

In short, Goa’s politics has been moving around the Land right from
the ancient period till date. It has gone through many phases of
community farming, feudal dynasties, the feudal Communidades and
Bhatkarshai. Then through democratic means we achieved Land to the
Tiller but the political class who succeeded the architects of Goa
made a mockery of the whole ‘socialist’ concept. And now it is being
ridiculed further by reckless conversion of cultivable land into a
saleable commodity. The land sharks from all over the world are simply
looting Goa’s precious land in collusion with the businessminded
politicians and spineless bureaucrats. This is the state of our
Bhangarachem Goem (Golden Goa)! The Golden Goose?  The whole journey
of the Politics of Land could be defined in three simple phases:

Land to the Tiller! 

Land to the Dealer!! 

Land to the Killer!!!
