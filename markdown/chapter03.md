### Chapter 3
# HISTORY OF *BHUMIPUTRAS*

The history of Goa does not begin with the Portuguese
conquest of Goa in 1510. Rather, it ends with the
end of Portuguese colonisation, just 60 years ago.

The Portuguese conquered the first island of Goa in the 16th
century. Vasco da Gama discovered India for the European traders. When
he landed first on 20 May 1498 at Calicut, he was guided by an Arab
pilot. India at that time was trading with Arabs, due to which the sea
is called the Arabian Sea.

Neither does the history of Goa begin with Lord Parashuram, an
incarnation of Lord Vishnu’s Dashavatara. The 'Sahyadri Khand', which
tells us of his tale was added to the 'Skand Purana' later, probably to
establish that Goa or *Gomantak Bhumi* was created by Lord Parashuram
and that the Brahmins were the first settlers of Goa. One of the
legends says that Parashuram, the warrior sage, stood on the peak of
the Sahyadri Ghat and shot an arrow towards the sea. The water receded
and the land rose from the sea. It was filled with salt and unsuitable
for habitation; so Parashuram invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat
holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out
of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and
guardians of the land.[^1]

The 'Sahyadri Khand' terms the Himalayas as *Devatma* (soul of the Gods)
and Sahyadri as *Viratma* (soul of the heroes).  The entire Sahyadri
range does not touch the sea anywhere from River Tapi to Kanyakumari,
because of Lord Parashuram’s heroic work. The Sapt Konkan, which
Parashuram created from the North to the South includes Chiplun,
Guhagar (now in the Konkan region of Maharashtra), Gomantak, Karahat,
Karnat and Tuludesh. Parashuram then got Brahmins settled in Sapt
Konkan, which included Bhargava, Nagare, Chitpavan, Karhade, Saraswat,
Havik and Nambudri.[^2]

You may ask why this controversial issue is raised here as we discuss
the elections and politics of Goa. It is not only important, rather
the most important point, because the legend of Parashuram Bhoomi is
directly connected to the land holdings of Goa, around which the
politics of Goa has been moving right from ancient times till date. It
is thus important to know who were the early settlers of Goa, to whom
the land belonged to, how the Brahmins and a few Kshatriya Sardar
classes became the *Bhatkars* (landlords) of Goa, and how the
*Bahujan* politics evolved in Free Goa.

## The Myth of *Parashuram Bhoomi*

This mythological legend is challenged by many historians.
It primarily tries to say that the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins were
the first settlers in *Gomant Bhoomi* due to which it is called
Parashuram Bhoomi. The tale claims that Parashuram brought
96 Saraswat Brahmin families from Tirhut (probably in Gaur,
Bengal, now in Bihar) in Northern India and got them settled
in the most fertile region of the Konkan, that is Goa. Out of
them, 66 families occupied the 66 villages of Sasastti (Salcete),
and the remaining 30 families settled in the 30 villages of
Tees-wadi (Tiswadi). Thereafter, these Brahmin families spread
out into the neighbouring areas of Baradesh (of 12 villages -
Bardez), Pedne, Kudal (Sawantwadi), and other parts of the
Konkan.

While quoting several other historians, Gerard Pereira, an expert in
history and political science, raises eyebrows over this myth:[^3]

[^3]: Pereira Gerard A: An outline of pre-Portuguese History of Goa

> *“The legend of Parashurama’s reclamation of Goa and the subsequent
> settlement of the Saraswats therein, is questionable from both
> geographical and historical points of view. If the Gaud Saraswats
> were the first and early settlers in Goa, then how do we account for
> the existence of Dravidians, aboriginal Gavdas and Kunbis and other
> Aryan groups prior to their settlement?  The legend itself would
> want us to believe that the mythical Parashurama annihilated the
> Kshatriyas not less than twentyone times before ‘creating’ new lands
> of Konkan. That would mean that the Konkan regions including Goa
> were inhabited by other people before the Gaud Saraswats came on the
> scene.”*

Prof D D Kosambi, a renowned historian and a Goan by origin, argues
that such a dense, trackless mountainous jungle infested by snakes and
tigers, was fit only for hardy pioneers; the strong west-coast monsoon
brings on a rapid growth of the forest, which no Brahmin settlers
could possibly have cleared without a labour supply. The problem was
solved in remarkable fashion, by sharing profit between the Brahmins
to whom the land was given and the actual workers on the land
recruited from the aboriginal Gaudas (still both caste and tribe),
with a few Kunbi and other low caste peasants.

Pereira also quotes Dr Bhau Daji Lad, who states that 

> *“it does not appear that the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins came to Goa
> prior to 1000 CE but some seven to eight centuries ago.”*

The geologists, archaeologists, and historians have finally put this
controversy to rest by explaining scientifically, how the entire
Konkan coast got created. Anant Ramkrishna Sinai Dhume, a historian,
in his acclaimed book *The Cultural History of Goa: From 10,000 BC to
1352 AD*, states:

> *“..the cultural history of Goa...; begins from the appearance of the
> land of Goa from the depths of the saline waters of the Arabian Sea,
> which occurred due to the seismic movement of Earth which took place
> at the end of the fourth pluvial period of the southern terrestrial
> globe in about 10,000 B.C. As a result of this seismic movement, a
> strip of the sea-bottom from the mouth of the Tapti river in the North
> to Kanyakumari in the South, along with the adjacent area of the
> Deccan trap closest to the sea, was elevated above the sea
> waters. This elevation resulted in the Sahyadri and Nilgiri
> ranges. The bottom of the sea rose near the trap-border about 600 m
> above the mean sea-level.”*[^4]

[^4]: Sinai Dhume Anant R: The Cultural History of Goa, From 10000 BC - 12352 AD. P 334


Dhume substantiates this contention by quoting Dr Gerhard Oertel, a
German citizen and professor of Geology at Pomona College, Claremont,
California in the USA. Oertel headed a commission set up by the
Portuguese government, consisting of mining engineers and geologists,
to study the mineral occurrences and geology of the territory of
Goa. He worked from December 1953 to September 1954 and even wrote a
book on it, titled ‘*Geologia de Goa*’. However he could not visit the
northern portion of Sattari and north-eastern part of Pernem, due to
the liberation movement going on in this area.

Dhume also quotes Dr Darashaw Nosherwan Wadia (regarded as the Father
of Indian Geology), zoologists EL Jordan and Dr PS Verma as well as
several other experts to support his claim.

However, Dhume does believe that Parashuram was a historic figure,
rather than a legendary or mythical figure. He dates him back to 2400
BCE, and not 10,000 BCE, when a conflict had taken place between the
Haihayas (clans ruling in western and central India) and the
Brahmins. “*The origin of the legend of Parashurama is traced back to
the aborigines who transmitted it to new-settlers,*” he states.[^5]

[^5]: ibid P 26

Pereira, who was also an eminent Leftist trade union leader of Goa,
concludes the whole controversy in this manner:

> “*From the above discussion, it can be stated that the Gaud Saraswat
> Brahmins are late-comers in Goa and their existence cannot be traced
> earlier than 1000 A.D. In the ‘Gada Parva’ of the Mahabharata, it is
> stated that Saraswat, a son of Rishi Dadichi, who lived on the banks
> of river Saraswati (probably Sarsuti near Thaneshwar in the Punjab),
> gave shelter and fed some sixty-thousand (Satsahastra) Aryan
> Brahmins; they came to him when there was a ravaging famine in
> Northern India for twelve years; they were fed on the fish diet
> obtained from the river Saraswati.*
>
> *Subsequently, with the Aryan colonisation of Northern India, the

> Bengal (Gaur) and other regions. And it is from Tirhut that the
> Brahmin Parashurama brought them to Goa. It may be inferred that
> they were named Saraswat after the river Saraswati and Gaud after
> their original abode at Tirhut in Gaur (Bengal).*
>

> taluka where they still exist in two temples.*”

Even today in the 21st century, has the situation changed?  People
from all over the world visit Goa as tourists, fall in love with the
place and decide to settle down by either buying a small flat or a
piece of land to build a palatial house. Precisely due to this, from
that ancient time to now, land in Goa has become the most significant
component of the Goan economy, around which the politics of Goa moves.


## Who Were the First Settlers?

The question thus remains: Who were the first settlers of Goa, whom
did the land belong to, and how did the feudal system evolve – with
Bhatkar and Kull or Mundkar? How did the Gaunkari evolve into the land
holdings by the Communidades?  Only history can tell us the truth,
provided we dig out the real truth and the real history. Not the
ruler-centric history written by the rulers but by the ruled-centric,
excavated by historians, sociologists, and researchers, based on
ground realities. Gerard Pereira aptly says:[^6]

[^6]: Pereira Gerald A: An Outline of Pre-Portuguese History of Goa

> *“History is not made by a few rulers and kings, nor should it mean
> just their so-called great feasts and achievements.  History is made
> by the people − the Gavdas, Kunbis and the poor peasants who tilled
> the land and helped the advancement of the mode of production from
> the days of early mankind.  The common people create history in the
> course of struggle for existence. Naturally, the clash continues
> permanently between the rulers and the ruled.”*

The subsequent and consistent digging of history by the historians and
archaeologists has gone back to 10,000 BCE when the first settlement
was found in Goa, of hunter-gatherers.  Scientific studies conducted
by experts provide us with a detailed scenario :[^7]

[^7]: Wikipedia: History of Goa

> “*Until 1993 the existence of humans in Goa during the Paleolithic
> and Mesolithic period was highly debated. The discovery of rock art

No evidence however is found till date whether these
hunter-gatherers finally settled down in Goa.

## *Mundari, Kol, Asura*

According to Dhume, while the Konkan coast was created due to seismic
movement 10000 BCE, the pluvial rains continued, though with
diminishing intensity, for one thousand years:[^8]

[^8]: Sinai Dhume Anant R: The Cultural History of Goa, From 10000 BC - 12352 AD. P 334-336

> *“During this period mud and salt of marine origin continued to be
> de-salted and the process of cohesion started and continued
> slowly... By 9000 BC, the pluvial rains suddenly stopped and the
> climate became very hot and completely dry.  Soon after came the
> high winds from the West to the East. The influence of these
> cyclones impacted some areas of the west coast from Britain to
> India, and even Iran and other countries of the terrestrial globe,

> pressure, and thus were fossilized in caverns.*
>
> *With habitats disrupted by the sudden environmental impacts, people

> tops of mountains, but even low lying areas suffered with the
> deposits of hot silt and sand up to a great height. This situation
> probably continued for about 500 years in the west coast of
> India. And after the cessation of this calamity, and with regular
> seasonal rains, the surviving population continued their migration

> west up to the sea-shore. From around 5000 B.C. security among
> settlements in Goa was more or less assured.*
>
> *During the period when man dwelled in caverns, there was scarcity of

> and there in small groups in search of food and sweet water. Even
> these groups did not try to settle permanently. They were forced to

> selected for settlements. Simultaneously, by natural instinct
> especially among the women folk, they practised rudimentary
> agriculture, cultivating wild grain and fruit and preparing
> mud-vessels for storing the grain.*
>
> *The people from North as well as the South came to occupy the
> new-born area starting from the western foot of the Sahyadri and
> Nilgiri ranges. The human folk which first established themselves in
> Goa are those that came from the foothills of the Sahyadri

> implements. So their food was only that which was produced
> spontaneously. They ate flesh but only of the beasts already
> dead. Kills with stone were rare. They worshipped only the dead
> ancestors, believing in the existence of spirits.”*

The next migration, according to Dhume, was in 4000 BCE, of a
buffalo-rearing pastoral tribe from South India.  They followed a
matrilineal system. They had knowledge of domestication of animals and
after centuries were eventually divided into two groups, the *Naik*
caste and a second group of the matriarchal system consisting of
*Chedvans*, *Bhavins* and *Kalavants* and their brothers.

By 3500 BCE there migrated another tribe called the *Asura*, from the
northern area around Chota-Nagpur, a plateau of around 65,000 square
kilometres in eastern India. It covers much of today’s Jharkhand state
as well as adjacent parts of Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal, and
Chhattisgarh. They started agriculture by the cut-and-burn method,
locally known as the *Kumeri* system and produced cereals. The
*Kumeri* system of shifting agriculture continues till date.

They were later subdued by the subsequent *Kol* tribe who dispossessed
them of their land. For livelihood, they shifted to other professions
like black-smiths, potters, and even landless labourers while some
formed part of the Vani caste. The Bharvankar caste in the Christian
community is of this stock.

The next migration Goa witnessed was in 3000 BCE (5000 years ago) of
*Kols*, *Mundaris*, and *Kharwas*, from the same area as the
*Asuras*. The *Kols* occupied the lands, cultivated paddyfields and
organised a village-socio-economic administration, establishing a
‘*Barazan*’, that is a group generally formed of twelve hamlets of
villages. Their main goddess was *Roinn*, the anthill, which was later
named as *Santer*. They were later called *Santerkar*, which then got
renamed as *Satarkar*. Being primarily a *Kullwadi* caste, Dhume
divides *Satarkars* into two categories: (1) *Satarkars* of Ponda
taluka and Rivona village in Sanguem (a small settlement is also found
in Loliem village of Canacona - Author) and (2) *Satarkar*, a lower
Maratha caste in Sanguem, Sattari, Bicholim, and Pernem talukas.

The *Mundaris*, who probably came after the *Kols*, worked under their
hegemony. They had no special cultural features, except for the
worship of a forest-tree named *Kel*. The *Munda* tribe enjoyed the
highest status among all the tribes such as *Kols*, *Hos* (*Larka
Kols*), *Santals*, *Bhumija*, *Korwars*, *Juang*, *Birhor*, *Asuras*
and so on. The word *Mundkar*, meaning ‘protector’ of property, is
derived from this *Mundari* word.

According to Dhume, the Gavddo tribe belongs to two different
settlements. One belongs to the *Asur-Munda* tribe, which came from
Chota Nagpur. The Satarkars, originally from Advai village of Sattari,
shifted to Savoi-Verem (for reasons not known), defeated the *Gavdde*
there and established their settlement. These *Gavdde* must have then
settled elsewhere in Goa.

The second tribe migrated along with the Goud Saraswat Brahmins from
Kannauj (Uttar Pradesh) and established themselves at Kutthali
(Cortalim). They are called *Kelshi- Kutthalkar Gaudde.* They are
believed to have developed the Khazan lands in Madkai, across the
Zuari river.

According to Dhume, *Kullambi* is originally not a caste or tribe, but
the cultivating class. It represents the professional status of
different ethnic groups of lower status in Goan society whose main
means of substance was agriculture. Who are these Kullambis? The
Christian Gaudde from Salcete, the Christian Bharvankar Gaudde from
Salcete and Quepem, the Velips and Gaonkars of Sanguem and Canacona as
well as Konkani *Kunbis* who migrated to North Canara. All these
settlements have their *Mhal* leader, who is called *Gaonkar*.

The *Kharwis* came probably along with the *Mundaris*, but there is no
proof for their independent settlement in village form. They took to
the profession of fishing and boating and formed the present *Kharvi*
(fishermen) community.

## Aryans, the Latecomers

The advent of the Aryans began around 2400 BCE, almost six to seven
centuries after the first settlement arrived in Goa in 9000 BCE. It
was the end of the Rigvedic age and the Aryans from the Indus valley
were highly influenced by it. The Indus Valley civilisation was the
most widespread, its sites spanning an area stretching from today’s
northeast Afghanistan (Gandhar), through much of Pakistan (most of the
Sindhu Pradesh), and into western and north-western India. The tale of
Parashuram is connected with the first phase of migration of Goud
Saraswat Brahmins − Bhargavas and Angiras, especially in Salcete,
Tiswadi, and Bardez talukas.

They lived in a joint family and the patriarch had full powers over
the members of the family. He was almost like a king. His jurisdiction
expanded as the joint family expanded into a large federation of
several natural families springing from a common ancestor, living in
the same village. This system is found to be prevalent among all the
Indo-European communities, which establishes the fact of where the
first wave of Aryans came from.[^9]

[^9]: Sinai Dhume Anant R: The Cultural History of Goa, From 10000 BC - 12352 AD. P 173

They were not nomads. They lived a settled life and built cottages of
wood and thatch for their dwellings. Milk and its products were the
most important part of their food, besides cakes of rice or barley,
porridge, as well as meats of goats and sheep which were
sacrificed. The cow was considered to be sacred and could not be
killed. They did not interfere with the life, religion, customs,
festivities, or even the Barazan system of the earlier settlers. But
they obviously held sway over the others because of their superiority
in attack and defence strategies. They knew how to make swords,
helmets, hand-guards, armour, etc. of steel.

This immigration from the North continued. References of more
migrations of Havig Brahmins are found during the Kadamba regime in
the fourth to sixth century and Madhvacharya’s sect in the 13th
century.[^10] Later, during religious conversions by the Portuguese,
these Brahmins also migrated outside Goa, especially to Karnataka and
Kerala.

The second wave of Aryan migration occurred around 700
CE when the entire bed of the Saraswati river of a length of about
1500 kilometres supposedly disappeared and the people along
its banks suffered a severe drought. This led to the migration of
Aryans as well as non-Aryans to various parts of India.

Since the river Saraswati is mentioned only in the Rigveda,
experts have been debating over its exact location. It is believed
that the river originated in the high Himalayas and descended
to the plains in Haryana, Punjab, adjoining parts of Pakistan
and joined the Arabian sea at Rann of Kutch in Gujarat. Some
geologists claim that the Saraswati could have been a major
all-season river in the Indus-Yamuna interfluve. Claims are also
made that it has remained as the Ghaggar-Hakra intermittent river
between India and Pakistan, which flows only in the monsoons
and ends at the Thar desert. There are also counter-claims made
that the river never existed and that all this is just myth.[^11]

[^10]: Ibid P 179
[^11]: Wikipedia: Ghaggar-Hakra river

India’s eminent historian Romila Thapar does not dispute that the
Saraswati river existed, but refuses to buy the argument that it is
the Ghaggar:

> “*The identification of the Ghaggar with the Sarasvati, mentioned in
> the Rig-Veda, is controversial. Furthermore, the early references to
> Sarasvati could be to the Haraxvati Plain in Afghanistan… This has
> led to the theory that originally the Old Iranian and Indo-Aryan
> speakers were a single group but dissensions led to their splitting
> up. It was then that the Indo- Aryan speakers living in the
> Indo-Iranian borderlands and the Haraxvati (Sarasvati) area of
> Afghanistan gradually migrated to the Indus plain, bringing with
> them their language, rituals and social customs, to settle as
> agro-pastoralists in the Sapta- Sindhu.*”[^12]

The second wave of Aryans in Goa consisted of Saraswat
Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and even Gaudde. The Saraswat
Brahmins were from Kosala in Chattisgarh as well as from Chedi.
The Bhoja Kshatriyas were from Ujjain and Chediyas from the
Chedi kingdom, from Bundelkhand, both from Madhya Pradesh.
Besides Vaishyas, the families also consisted of artisans and of
non-Aryan stock from Goud, known in Goa as Gaudde. They
came by the road route, from Mathura and Ujjain, and then to the
South by western coast to Laat in Gujarat to Goa. Some Saraswat
Brahmins, who had taken up trade in Laat in Gujarat, came by
sea later in 700 CE and joined them in Goa to settle down.[^13]

## Game-Changer Iraqi Sumerians

In between the first and second migration of Aryans, there
was a significant migration around 2000 BCE from Sumer, which
is today part of Iraq. Why were the Sumerians so significant?
It is because the world’s first civilisation had been created in
Mesopotamia under the Sumerian leadership. They were a
highly knowledgeable tribe among those who had settled in
Goa in terms of weapons, housing, cuisine, and all other facets
of community living. They were into trade with Egypt and India,
including Goa, of gold, cedar, and copper. They knew about the
location as well as the environment and facilities for settlement
in Goa. Through the Persian Gulf, the sea route took them about
three years to reach Goa.

Though proficient in agricultural activity, a famine hit them
very badly, which compelled them to migrate. History says that
about 2,000 B.C, “the civilisation of Sumer had been kindled
there, sparks had leapt to Egypt and India.” Anant Sinai Dhume
is perhaps the first person who proved this migration with
various kinds of evidence that indicate Sumerian settlement in
those cities.

Who were these Sumerians settled in Goa almost 4000
years ago? Mainly the Padhye Brahmins, and also quite a few of
the smith class:[^14]

> *“All the people who migrated from Sumer could not have sheltered in
> Goa, so that people travelled to the south of Goa by the
> sea-route. It appears that the families of the highest class,
> Paddyas, settled in Goa and persistently maintained their customs
> whereas the families of other classes, mainly artisans and craftsmen
> and perhaps some families of the highest caste travelled to the
> south (India) where they might have amalgamated their customs with
> those of the original settlers of these areas.”*

[^14]: Sinai Dhume Anant R: The Cultural History of Goa, From 10000 BC - 12352 AD. P 116-167

But then where did the name Paddya or Padhye originate from? Dhume
links it to one of the Sumerian kings, whose name was
A-an-ni-pad-da. Being from the highest class among all, they called
themselves Paddye. *“And similarly, with slight deviation, the
families of lower class named themselves ‘Fatto’ and another family as
‘Maddo’. This last family settled in the area now known as Marcaim
(Madkai) which is probably a version of Maddaki, as the word ‘ki’
means land in the Sumerian language.”* They came from the city of Ur,
situated on the shores of Persian Gulf, from which Dhume feels the
name of a village in Ponda taluka − Orgao − could have been derived.

Their first settlements were in three talukas − Ponda, Bardez, and
Salcete. Even today the highest number of Padhye Brahmins are found in
Ponda taluka. In Bardez, they settled in Serula and Betim-Verem and in
Varca village of Salcete taluka.

The migration of the Sumerians brought changes in the thinking process
of even the first wave of Aryans, who began to follow their
customs. Their culture is deeply rooted in Goa today, perhaps because
it was a dominant ruler-priest class.  They brought the concept of a
permanent structure for God − a temple − in Goa. As in the Sumerian
system, in the sanctum (garbh kood) of a temple, only the Bhat and the
Mahajans, who founded the temple, are allowed. The institution of
Devadasi system (dancing girls, temple servants, etc.) was also
brought to Goa by the Sumerians.

The most interesting elements are that of agriculture and land
management. The Padhyes introduced a special type of ploughshare made
of iron, and were skilled in reclaiming river land, constructing
dykes, and using land for cultivation. They were pioneers in shaping
the early methods of cultivation, with irrigation management and
modern ploughing tools. Even today, the Padhye Brahmins are considered
to be the most progressive farmers in Goa. They are also the real
models for the co-operative management of the agricultural economy, by
adapting the Gaunkari system to the changing modern times. The classic
example of this is the Goa Bagayatdar Sahakari Kharedi- Vikri
Sanstha. From buying and selling agricultural products at the optimum
price and providing all the agricultural tools, implements as well as
fertilisers and pesticides, the Bagayatdar today runs Goa’s best
supermarkets for the Goan consumer at a minimum possible price.

It was a tribal concept that land belonged to the whole community and
its deity. Land belonging to the king was an Aryan concept. And land
belonging to the village god or goddess was a Sumerian concept. The
early settlers of Goa, the tribals, developed a Gaunkari system for
the management of cultivable land. They cultivated collectively but
appropriated the cultivated produce individually. Administration of
the whole village was also run by the assembly of elders. The
Sumerians (or the Padhye Brahmins), to a large extent, transferred
this authority to the local temple and its managers. They introduced
the concept of collective farming, through this authority, with all
the obligations of maintenance and repairs of dykes and irrigation
systems placed upon the cultivators. The templepalace played a crucial
role in mediating the relationships and disputes between farmers,
herdsmen, fishermen, craftspecialists, and the State.

The Sumerians built temples in Goa. Houses were typically built with
an entrance room, an open courtyard, verandah, passages from one room
to the other rooms, kitchen, etc. They also devised the irrigation
system, dug up canals, and maintained them to prevent silting. A lot
of labour was engaged in all these activities. Perhaps this was the
first major construction activity that had taken place in Goa. And for
this, the construction labour was imported. This labour class also
settled in Goa and became Goans − our ancestors!

The Padhye Brahmins are quite different from the Saraswat Brahmins in
terms of the agricultural relations they maintain with the farmers,
tenants, and even the landless agricultural labour. They personally
work in the fields and hold dignity of labour in their social
approach. Also, the Gauda and Kunbi-Velip communities have immense
respect for the Padhye Brahmins as compared to the Saraswat Brahmins
with ‘bhatkar’ mentality.

Perhaps this is the reason Sudin Dhavalikar is unbeatable in Madkai,
which has a sizable vote bank of Gawda community.  His brother Deepak
also rides this ancestral legacy in the tribal dominated Priol
constituency. This could be the reason why the Bhahujan Samaj feels
quite comfortable when he heads a party like the MGP.

Ajit Painginkar, a veteran journalist from Canacona and a researcher
of folk art, tells me that the Kunbi-Velip community even in his
taluka is found to be more connected with the Padhey Brahmins than the
other communities. Both the communities, even three decades ago, had
lots of similarities in terms of the hard work they put in, their
involvement in agriculture, their lifestyle and even the attire
including the *chenchi* (a pouch with a string to sling it around the
shoulder) of paan-tambakhu (tobacco paan). Both the communities are
also staunch temple devotees.

While both these communities developed the Gaunkari system of
community farming together, they imported the construction labour from
other parts of the country, who are now settled in Goa. It is a
similar situation to what we witness in Goa today where the labour
class is imported from other parts of the country and they too are
slowly settling down in Goa. The cultural confrontation between the
insiders and outsiders remains for one or two generations after which
they also become Niz Goenkar, like how our ancestors became and
started calling ourselves “Original Goans”.

Goans were confronted with a major controversy when the BJP
government, in 2021, introduced a Bhumiputra bill. The debate led to
who is the Bhumiputra and who is an outsider migrant. From the ancient
history before any dynasty started ruling Goa, can we define who is a
Bhumiputra and who is an outsider? Is migration a modern phenomenon?
Or is the history of Goa full of migrations, from all over the world
as well as different parts of India? What are we originally? Iraqis?
Afghanis?  Pakistani? Indo-Europeans? Aryans? Dravidians? Bengalis?
Odiyas? Jharkhandi? Bihari? Madhya Pradeshi? Chattisgarhi?  Gujarati?
*Mundaris*? *Kol*? Sumerians? Arabs?

If we analyse this history, we find that different tribes came down
and settled in Goa in different centuries. And here Goa’s politics has
started moving around a migration, which is not even one century
old. 1961 to 2021 is the tail end of the 20th century and the early
beginning of the 21st century. The history of barely 60 years!
