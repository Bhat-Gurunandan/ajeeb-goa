### Chapter 4
# *GAUNKAR* TO *BHATKAR*


Who doesn’t like to live in Goa? Its pristine natural beauty from the
coast to the Sahyadri Ghat, the coconut groves, lush green paddy
fields, hospitable people, and the culture of freedom tempts anybody
and everybody from all around the world. Even when Goa was not
‘developed’, in ancient times, there are umpteen instances of people
passing through this coastal state and falling in love with its
ambience and settling here for their lifetime.

Obviously, due to the unique desirability of this tiny state, land has
remained a crucial issue right from ancient times till date. Goa’s
politics has always moved around its land. When the initial settlers
arrived, it was for agriculture. Then as almost 16 dynasties ruled
here till the Portuguese arrived, it was for national and
international trade. And from liberation in 1961 till today, it has
been about the hospitality and housing industry.  For the last 10,000
years, in some form or other, acquisition of land has been a key
factor in Goa, around which even fierce battles were fought in
history.

There is hardly a national celebrity in any field like industry,
film, theatre, literature, sports, or journalism who does not have
a house or at least a flat in Goa. Those who don’t have one, have
certainly been dreaming about it. Due to this the agricultural
land is being mercilessly converted for residential purposes by
throwing all the rules and regulations to the wind. As a result,
Goa witnessed a massive agitation in 2006 against a Regional
Plan that would have converted the entire green state into a
concrete jungle. Due to this short-term ugly mentality of the
political and bureaucratic class, agro-based establishments have
been ‘unanimously’ mauled through the so-called democratic
institutions, right from village panchayats to the State Assembly.

It is therefore imperative to analyse the entire journey of the
precious land of Goa, right from ancient times till date, to see how
the ruling classes have destroyed the prosperous future of Goa and
Goans.

## The Ancient Democrats

*Gaunkar* is not a mere surname for Goa or a Konkani word for a
villager. It has a rich tradition behind it – *Gaunkari* – a highly
revered democratic institution of community living and land holding
that was prevalent from 3000 BCE. It is a system that is over 5000
years old, that has been ruined in the last 500 years, especially
after the Portuguese conquered Goa. The Portuguese converted the
*Gaunkari* system into the Communidades. But this was not just a
replacement with a Portuguese word for the same institution. Both the
systems work as village cooperatives. But yet there is a huge
difference. A *Gaunkari* was a cooperative of all the villagers. A
Communidade is a cooperative of a privileged few. A Communidade is a
‘private village’; a *Gaunkari* was a ‘public village’.

*Gaunkari* is a 5000-year old public institution, started by a group of
tribes like the Kols, Mundaris, and Kharwas, who had settled in Goa in
3000 BCE. They are today called Satarkar, Gaudde, and Kharvi. *Gaunkari*
is still prevalent among the tribal communities like Satarkars, Gaudde
and Velips, if not among the fisherfolk community.

A similar system is still prevalent among the Mundari tribe in West
Bengal, from where our tribals had travelled down.  *Barazan* is a
common system practiced by these Goan tribes as well as by the Kols
and Mundaris in Chota Nagpur. In both the states, the system is now
reduced to a religious entity. There are still places called *Barazan*
in Sattari and Sanguem, while the Portuguese records reveal that many
places had this name in the three talukas of the Old Conquests.[^1]

*Khunti* is another word found in both these places.  Jharkhand has a
district called *Khunti*. And the heroic struggle from Birsa Munda till
date to get their ancestral land restored from the landlords is over
the *Khunt* Katti land. The villages are called *Khunt* Katti villages and
the cultivators the *Khunt Kattidar*.[^2] In Goa, among these tribals,
*Khunti* signifies a deity − a stone placed in an open yard. Till date
these *khuntis* are worshipped by Goan tribes in the villages of Ponda,
Bicholim, Quepem, Canacona, and Sanguem.[^3]

According to Arvind Khutkar, a senior bureaucrat in the Goa
administration, khunti was the term primarily used to set boundaries
of each village by piercing a wooden pole (*khunti*) at all its four
corners. In his Kalay village of Sanguem taluka, there are also
*rakhandars* (protector deities) worshipped at six different places in
all the directions at these village borders, called *Charvadyancho
Aajo, Kuddo Aajo, Mhal Khunti, Vagro Siddh (Dhal *Khunti*),
Shelincho Aajo* and *Devagat*. The families of khuntkars, who are
traditionally the tribal priests (Jalmi or Velip), are given the
responsibility of worshipping all these *rakhandars*. Tribes with the
surname Khutkar are also found in Harvalem village of Bicholim,
Panchwadi village of Ponda, Paddem (Paroda) village of Quepem, as well
as in Mollem, the neighbouring village of Kalay.

[^3]: Sinai Dhume Anant R: The Cultural History of Goa, From 10000 BC - 12352 AD. P 103

The system is slightly different in interior areas like Khotigao or
Gaodongri in Canacona. Devidas Gaonkar, a young journalist and
researcher from Khotigao, says their villages have a place called
*Khunti* right in the middle of the village. A tall stone stands there,
around which 10 square meters of area is considered to be sacred. You
are not even allowed to spit there.

During the first stage of their settlement in Goa, the Gaudde,
Satarkar, and Velip tribes started cultivation in the *marad* land in
the hilly areas. In the second stage, they developed an amazing method
of reclamation of low-lying, mangrove-fringed, coastal saline lands on
the river banks and made it cultivable by constructing two bunds −
internal and external. They are called *khazan* lands in Goa. The
Gauddes transited from a ‘hunterfood gatherer’ stage to a settled
lifestyle in competition with the Kharvis. As they shifted from
hillside forests in search of more fertile land, pressure on marginal
coastal lands led to the discovery of the art and science of the
*khazan* lands. Even today, this community maintains the traditional
eco-technological knowledge about the creation, repair, and
maintenance of the *khazan* lands.[^4]

This tribal community strongly believed in community living and
community farming, for which they evolved a system called
*Gaunkari*. This was a three-tier system where all the decisions
regarding cultivation, land management, community living, and
religious rituals were taken collectively. The place where this
collective activity took place in an open central place was called a
*Maand*. It exists till date. The democratic procedure set up to meet,
discuss, and resolve the issues was called *Ganvponn*. The actual
meeting of the people was called *bhous* or *bhousar*. The priest
conducting religious rituals was called *Jalmi* or *Velip*. The leader of
the community was called *Gaunkar* or *Budvont*. (The community
respectfully calls them *Gaunkar*, people from other communities call
them *Budvont*, since he is the most senior and knowledgeable person
in the community.[^5]) Both of them, the *Jalmi* and the *Gaunkar* till
date, are the most respectable personalities and leaders among the
tribal communities. All the issues and even family disputes were
discussed and resolved at the *mandd* through *Ganvponn*. The *Gaunkar*
has the final word in this regard. However, each and everyone is
allowed to speak, raise objections, and debate on all the issues. A
highly democratic system indeed![^6]

## Revenue-Moulding of *Gaunkari*

The Iraqi Sumerians (Padhye Brahmins) settled down in Goa in 2000 BCE,
almost 1000 years after the Gaudde and other tribes had occupied the
land. They had a similar concept of community farming, but they
believed that land belonged to God. As they also brought in the
concept of temples, the management of the *Gaunkari* gradually shifted
to the founders of the village temples. They had special types of
ploughs, iron implements, and knowledge of irrigation systems, like
construction of dykes etc. They moulded the primitive *Gaunkari* system
to their Sumerian style. Regular maintenance and repairs of the
irrigation systems was done through the *Gaunkari*, for which the
surplus produce was used to nourish the agricultural labour (Perhaps
this led to another migration of landless agricultural labour).[^7]

[^7]: Sinai Dhume Anant R: The Cultural History of Goa, From 10000 BC - 12352 AD. P 153

Eventually, the *Gaunkari* institution was strengthened further by
streamlining the systems like keeping records, passing resolutions,
setting up rules for administration as well as introducing voting
systems for decision-making etc. Following an uproar over the
destructive Regional Plan, Avinash Raikar and Dr Sharon D’Cruz
published a research paper in Economic & Political Weekly in February
2006, throwing more light on the *Gaunkari* system, the Communidades
instituted by the Portuguese, as well as the further erosion of the
*Gaunkari* in democratic India:

> “*Everything, from ploughing to distribution and deficit was
> regulated on a cooperative basis. The reclamation and development of
> the fertile ‘khazan’ land was entrusted to a group (‘*bhous*’). This
> resulted in the creation of a regional agro-based society, where the
> cultivation and administration of village land was undertaken by a
> cooperative of coparcenaries called the ‘Gaonponn’ (council of
> village representatives). Each councillor represented a clan
> (*vangod*) that existed at the time of the formation of the
> council. The size of the village council varied according to the
> number of the clans.*
>
> *The meeting of the Council was held at a ‘chaudi’ (central place in
> the village). They had their own set of rules and regulations
> (‘mandavoli’). Each councillor had one vote (‘mot’).  All the
> ‘nemos’ (resolutions) had to be passed unanimously and entered in a
> register (‘vahi’). A nay (‘naka’) was a veto and a single person
> could block the decision of the rest.*
>
> *The fertile land was auctioned triennially. The villagers were
> informed about it five nights in advance (‘panch rati’). The
> Gaonkars gathered at the ‘Gaonponn’ to make land grants. In case a
> *Gaunkar* wanted to sell his rights, the Gaonponn had the right of
> preemption. If an outsider wanted to take a bid at the auction, he
> had to find a *Gaunkar* who could stand as a security for him. If the
> *Gaunkar* was unable to pay his taxes, his rights to the ‘zon’ were
> auctioned during his lifetime.*”

Meanwhile, various dynasties started ruling the Indian
territories. Goa was not an exception. Due to its natural harbours it
was highly sought after for sea trade, nationally as well as
internationally. However, none of these dynasties, till the advent of
the Portuguese, disturbed the *Gaunkari* system.  They however appointed
either a Jalmi or a *Gaunkar* to collect taxes from the cultivators, as
revenue for the kingdom. D D Kosambi explains this:

> “*...during ancient times, land was held in common and production
> was intended to fulfil the immediate needs of households. There was
> no question of a territorial unit as dynasties rose and fell and
> frontiers changed from time to time. The agrarian system was
> characterised by multiple and simultaneous claims on the land; the
> customary claims of villagers, conditional claims of the
> intermediaries and the superior claims of the sovereign. The life of
> the rural peasantry was unaffected by periodic changes in ruling
> dynasties as they were locally governed by unwritten codes and
> functioned as small republics. The question of ‘who owns the land’
> could not be answered as power structures and relations in arable
> lands were never the same. Land was an aggregate that was held in
> common and every peasant had the right to cultivate the land that
> belonged to his ancestors. The sovereigns were never interested in
> asserting their suzerainty over the land per se but were keen on
> getting a share of the agrarian produce. This share was then
> deposited in the common pool and was used to defray some of the
> common expenses of the village.  But the common property regimes
> cannot be understood within a standard theoretical construct as no
> single form of property existed all over the world.*”

Somewhere during these regimes, certain communities were allotted land
by the village administrators for the services they rendered. The
arable land was given to the priestly class, lowlands to the *Gaunkars*
and non-*Gaunkars*, the medium quality land (*namoxins*) given to the
temple or village servants and low quality land was rented out in
perpetuity either on a fixed rent (‘*cutubona*’) or a variable tax
(‘*vanty*’).  *Gaunkari* institutions also looked after public utility
works like building roads, cleaning paths, setting up and cleaning the
drainage system, constructing tanks for ablution, supplying drinking
water for cattle, forging water conduits, erecting bridges and dams
over the rivulets, putting up schools and ‘davarnne’ (stone platforms
for resting head loads), planting trees along the roads for shade,
etc.

In due course of time, the *Gaunkars* appropriated the right
to reclaim the land and hold it as their hereditary right. This
was strengthened by the Vijayanagar and Adil Shahi rulers who
inducted feudalism and landlordism into the agrarian sector.[^8]

## Communidades destroy the *Gaunkari*

A misconception is being widely spread that Communidade, a name
christened by the Portuguese in 1526, is nothing but the ancient
*Gaunkari* institution. It is called the unique model of communes, the
village republics, run by the cultivators till date within a
democratic set up of the Indian democratic republic.

The reality is far from this myth, which is being widely and proudly
spread all over the world. It is actually a harsh and brutal uprooting
of the basic concept of a commune. The whole process of dismantling
the original *Gaunkari* system began with the basic concept of the
Portuguese invaders, who strongly believed that land belonged to the
King. He was the ultimate authority, not the community or the local
deity.

When Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Goa in 1510, he had an eye on the
thriving trade centre of Old Goa. The Portuguese called only the
island of Tiswadi as Goa and they looked at the adjacent territories,
which they conquered later on, as a protective ring around the City of
Goa. Initially they were not dependent on land revenue. The lucrative
commercial activities that were carried out from the entrepot port
yielded them rich returns. But later in the 16th century, as they
started losing their hold over maritime trade, they brought sweeping
changes in the *Gaunkari* system and rechristened it as Communidades
with 49 clauses. The basic assumption was that the villages had lost
their ownership of the land to the Portuguese crown.[^9]

[^9]: Ibid (Quoting D D Kosambi 1947)

> “*They overhauled its internal mechanism to appropriate land rights
> and the agrarian surplus. They also introduced the concept of
> semi-private property or individual property rights in land. In the
> wake of evangelisation, the temples were destroyed and their lands
> were taken away. *Gaunkaria* rights were forcibly taken away from
> those villagers who resisted conversion. Religious persecution led
> to large-scale migration of the agro-based communities. All these
> lands were either gifted to the church (namoxim) or leased out to
> allies of the crown.  This resulted in violent local resistance of

> subcontinent. Those who helped the Portuguese in suppressing local
> rebellions were rewarded in terms of land. As a result of this, the
> commons lost their lands, allies of the crown became the proprietary
> owners of the land and the Portuguese were able to appropriate the
> agrarian surplus in a legal manner.*
>
> *They introduced a compulsory tax (foro real)... In case of a
> default, eight principal villages were responsible to pay the dues.
> (Neura o Grande, Ganssim, Ella, Azossim, Calapur, Morombim o Grande,
> Carambolim and Batim). The land in the defaulting villages could be
> leased out by auction during which period the Gaonkars lost their
> *Gaunkaria* rights. The general meeting of the chiefs of the group of

> administrative body at the *Gaunkaria*.  When a member of the
> *Gaunkarias* died without a male issue, got converted to Islam or
> Hinduism or continued to profess ‘his’ religion, his share lapsed to
> the king. These properties were then auctioned or gifted by the
> crown.*”

From the mid-sixteenth century the Communidades
began to gradually lose their independence due to religious
persecution, oppression, looting, etc. They were forced to
contribute annually towards church repairs, maintenance,
renovations, and even celebrating feasts and paying salaries of
the officiating priests.[^10]

special reference to the Communidade system: 1750-1910 (Thesis at Goa
University)

> punishments... In the event of default in the payment of the due
> foros, many were put to death and their grains, seed, cattle, oxen,
> etc were confiscated.*”

From the 17th century, the Portuguese went on dismantling the core of
the *Gaunkari* institution under the pretext of streamlining the
Communidades for the benefit of the State. This process continued till
1961, when finally Goa was liberated.  The backbone of the *Gaunkari*
was actually broken in the 17th century, by the introduction of a
feudal structure in the Communidades, the new land relations as
*Bhatkar* (landlord) and *kull* (tenants).

**1649** 
: The Council of Landed Properties declared that the state was the
‘lord of all the community lands’, the village councillors were the
vassals of the crown and the *Gaunkars* were its tenants. Paying *foro
corrente* (fixed tribute) by the gaunkar to the State was made
mandatory.

**1735**
: The 46 *capitulos* of Regimento maintained autonomy of the
Communidades but made the members, the administrator, scribe, and
president accountable to the Portuguese. Supervision of each mahal was
carried out by a judge appointed by the Government.

**1745**
: The unique veto system of even one gaunkar saying naka stalling the
decision was changed to the passing of resolutions by a simple
majority. The *Mahajans* and *Gaunkars* enjoyed a status that was based on
their class, occupation, and influence.

**1770**
: The *bhous* was institutionalised and empowered to clear wastelands.

**1776**
: An agricultural department was created to reclaim land under
punitive conditions. A superintendent was appointed to supervise the
development of agriculture and infrastructure.

**1836**
: A decree was issued, abolishing the posts of judge and chief
thanadar. Judicial cases were referred to the district judge.

**1871**
: The Regimento with eight additional articles was enforced to
regulate the functions of the village communities.  1880: A decree was
issued extending membership of the Communidades to the shareholders,
associates, and the public in general. In the new conquests, a new
system of shareholders (*accionistas*) was devised. The dividend of
the transferable shares and net income of the village community was
divided among non-*Gaunkar* shareholders, but they were not allowed to
take part in the administration. The State also started receiving the
share of surplus.

**1883**
: Loan Act was introduced during the Republican regime to improve
agricultural production.  1886: Nearly 465 articles were introduced
relating to the functions of officials, regulating powers of the
Government vis-à-vis the Communidades and procedures associated with
expenditure, recovery, deficit, debt, sales, mortgages,
accountability, records and registration of the latter.

**1905**
: Code of the Communidades was promulgated with 750 articles aimed at
developing its vast properties. The land was auctioned every three to
six years for cultivation. The ‘camara agraria’ was abolished and its
functions were passed on to the Communidades.

**1933**
: The code was reframed with 873 articles, inducting new settlers and
issuing non-transferable shares to them with fixed dividends.

**1961**
: Yet another Code of 660 articles was promulgated, by legally
abolishing the *bhous* and the government taking up the responsibility
of administering the Communidades.[^11]

This was the last nail in the coffin of the age-old *Gaunkari*
institution, just before Goa was liberated, which completely destroyed
the community spirit. No doubt the Code of Communidade streamlined its
democratic functioning in letter, but sadly, not in spirit. By this
time, Communidade itself had become a *Bhatkar*. On the other hand, the
influential and privileged landlords, most of whom were allies of the
Portuguese, had become its **Gaunkars** (with few exceptions).  And, if
required, the Government had all the powers to overrule any decision
of the **Gaunkars**. The Communidades also became a Sawakar
(moneylender), giving loans at four per cent interest against a
security of gold, silver or shares (accoes) of the Communidades.

## ‘Real Estate’ Communidades

Agriculture was a prime occupation when Goa was liberated
in 1961. Over 50,000 hectares of land was under paddy
cultivation. Today, in 2021, it has reduced to 35,000 hectares.  58
per cent of Goa’s population was involved in agriculture at the time
of liberation, which has dropped to barely 10 per cent today. The
rural population of Goa has reduced from 85 to 38 per cent. A large
number of cultivators have left their fields barren for over three
decades now. They live in the villages but work in urban areas or in
the tourism and other sectors in the coastal belt, while some
villagers work abroad or in shipping.  The net state domestic product
in the agricultural sector has also dropped from 35 per cent to a mere
3 per cent in the last 60 years.[^12]

[^12]: Indicators of Socio Economic Development - 2020: Directorate of
Planning & Statistics, Govt of Goa

A cadastral survey conducted around 1961 indicated that the
Communidades owned 35 to 85 per cent of the cultivable land in
Goa. The acreage owned by individual Communidades ranged from 200 to
400 hectares of land in the coastal tracts of Old Conquests and 2 to
40 per cent of the land in the hinterlands of Goa, the New
Conquests. In the Old Conquests, nearly half of the paddy fields were
owned by the Communidades, including large tracts of *khazans*. The
highest was in Bardez, where the Communidades owned 85 per cent of
agricultural land. The next were 60 per cent each in Salcete and
Mormugao.  Comparatively, it was only 35 per cent in Tiswadi.[^13]

The latest report by the Communidade Commission 2015 states that three
talukas in the Old Conquests − Tiswadi, Bardez and Salcete − have
around 60 per cent paddy area owned by the communidades. These three
talukas out of 11 (Dharbandora not considered) have 110 Communidades,
nearly half of the total 225 Communidades. The total area occupied by
all the Communidades is 37,783 hectares (37.83 crore square metres).
Out of this, 22,470 hectares (59%) of land is held by this institution
in the three talukas of Old Conquests. The remaining 15,313 hectares
of Communidade land is scattered in the rest of the eight
talukas.[^14]

Incidentally, the same three talukas have been getting congested with
constructions to house the urbanised Goans, migrated outsiders, and
lakhs of tourists. Goa had only 25 hotels and guest houses, only in
the major towns, at the time of liberation. Today the number has gone
to above 4000 hotels, resorts, guesthouses, etc. which are ‘registered
legally’. The coastal state receives above 78 lakh tourists every
year.[^15]

Actually the number of Communidades was almost double during the
Portuguese regime. But due to illegitimate interference by the
colonial power who kept on issuing sweeping decrees and exploited the
*Gaunkari* institution as a milking cow to overcome its economic
bankruptcy, the number of Communidades reduced substantially from 1750
to 1910.  It is worth investigating further who grabbed the land which
these ‘dissolved’ Communidades had owned at one time. The following
table is an eye opener:

As agriculture started becoming unproductive, a migratory trend began
in Goa from the villages to areas of opportunities.  Goans started
migrating to the cities, outside Goa and even abroad for
livelihood. They sought government employment or private jobs in
industries, mining and financial institutions and also took up
self-employment in the service industry. The flourishing hospitality
industry also emerged as a major source of income. The Communidades
lost their past glory. The barren Communidade land was occupied by new
‘working’ settlers from villages as well as the migrant working class
for building ‘illegal’ shelters. On the other hand, the consistently
rising graph of the housing industry became a boon for the dying
Communidades. Within no time, the one-time *Gaunkari* institution
emerged as a prime ‘real estate agent’ of Goa for all kinds of legal
and illegal constructions.

The Portuguese had started auctioning the Communidade
land triennially for cultivation to the highest bidder. With the
help of their political agents in the Goa Legislative Assembly,
in ‘democratic’ Goa, the system was replaced, initially leasing
out the land for 25 years, and now for 99 years. The bidders
became quasi-permanent owners of the community lands. The
agricultural land is now being blatantly converted for nonagricultural
(residential and commercial) purposes.[^16]

[^16]: Raikar Avinash & D’Cruz Dr Sharon: Democratic Management of
Common Property in Goa

“Today, the Communidades have become complex and unwieldy institutions
that are merely interested in collecting the ‘foro’ (tribute) and
distributing the surplus to Gaonkars in the form of ‘zono’
(shares)... The rents that were hitherto collected by the Communidades
are no longer claimed. The system of an annual, public auction of the
plots owned by the *Gaunkaria* is abolished... The Gaonkars, who have
immigrated, enjoy their ‘zons’ in absentia. They have acquired a
‘nouveau riche’ status, adopting a highly luxurious, leisure-oriented
lifestyle. They invest in real estate, hospitality concerns and
commercial complexes...  The market value of land has increased
tremendously... The common lands are now in the hands of tenants and
mundkars who are manipulated by land dealers and builders. Even the
waste lands are infiltrated upon... The rural poor who are priced out
in the process are also encroaching upon the Communidade lands... Many
outsiders came to settle down in the villages...  In the Communidades
the President, Attorney and Treasurer are elected on the basis of a
narrow, adult male franchise. The dominant social groups are able to
encroach on the land with the help of the latter. This has cut off the
access of the rural poor from their key physical and cultural
resources.”

There was a consistent demand from the time of the constitution of the
first Assembly of 1963 that the Communidades should be abolished. But
apparently the local Congress leadership impressed upon Goa’s central
rulers in Delhi to maintain these ‘private cooperatives’.[^17] Later,
in 1968, Chief Minister Bhausaheb Bandodkar assured the House that the
Communidades would be abolished. The MGP had already introduced the
Goa Tenancy Act in 1964 and had started the process of making the
tillers (tenants) the owners of their land. In tune with this, the
assurance was repeated in the third Assembly of 1972 by Pratapsingh
Rane, who was a revenue minister in MGP’s Bhausaheb Bandodkar ministry
and later in Shashikala Kakodkar’s cabinet after Bhau’s demise.[^18]

Subsequently a private resolution was also passed in the Assembly in
this regard. The issue was once again brought up at a historic party
conference held in Margao on 8 March 1975. Chief Minister Shashikala
Kakodkar had made two major announcements at this conclave: 1) To
immediately enforce the Goa Mundkar Act; and 2) To set up a committee
to study the issue of the Communidade and its proposed abolition. No
matter what happened to these series of debates in the Assembly and on
public platforms, the Communidades exist till date. Yet another report
of a commission was tabled in this Assembly six years ago, but even
the current Assembly is being wound up without discussing this most
crucial report.

No concrete steps were taken by any ruling party on the matter of the
Communidades, though every Assembly session sees heated debates on the
unbridled grabbing of Communidade land with a nexus between the
builders, politicians and office bearers of the Communidades. The
Serula Communidade tops the list. Finally, two presidents and one
attorney of three Communidades from South Goa approached the high
court in 2009, alleging maladministration, frauds and land grabbing.

They pointed out that the system of five-yearly convention of all the
Communidades was abandoned and not a single meeting (except one in
1997) was held since the Liberation of Goa. Pending hearing, the high
court ordered a convention of Communidades, which was held on 30th
October with daylong deliberations. They had resolved to hold the next
convention in January 2011. It never happened.

The high court accepted most of the recommendations made by the
convention and delivered its judgement on 5 February 2013. Within a
month, as per the court order, the government constituted a
Committee-cum-Commission, under the chairmanship of the Revenue
Minister, to hear the petitioners as well as all others concerned
about the future of the Communidades. After deliberating over the
issues in over 50 meetings and hearings, the Commission submitted its
report to the government on 23 February 2016. Since then, all the
governments belonging to various political parties have been sitting
over the report, with a standard reply in the Assembly: "*The report
is being examined.*”

The report has also attached a bill to be enacted in
the Assembly, suggesting several amendments to the Goa
Legislative Diploma No. 2070, which is based on the Code of
Communidade enacted by the Portuguese government on 15
April 1961, eight months before Goa Liberation. It has two
major amendments:

1. Amendment to Article 29 (insert sub-article 9): Those members
(components) against whom there is a complaint of encroachment on the
land of Communidade, unless and the offender proves his occupation by
a lawful grant, he shall be debarred from standing for election until
he surrenders the land encroached upon. This proves that members of
Communidade themselves have encroached upon the Communidade land. The
second amendment is:

2. Art 317: The Communidades are entitled to give lease, on a long
term basis, of their non-tenanted lands, for the purpose of
development of land for erection of the buildings…

It appears that the Communidade leaves scope to also convert
non-tenanted agricultural land for constructions. But then it has laid
down many conditions like inviting tenders for the project, a team of
architect, engineer and contractor scrutinising it, the general body
approving it and the profit is shared between the developer and
Communidade on a 60:40 basis.

Eleven years have passed since the petition was filed. Two Assembly
elections were held in between, in 2012 and 2017.  Politicians blaming
the BJP for all kinds of illegalities have crossed over and joined the
BJP governments, including the opposition leader belonging to the
Congress. A lady MLA, who switched over from the Congress, is the new
revenue minister today, while the third election is approaching. But
not a single political party has bothered to make it a public
issue. Everyone is quiet over it. A mysterious silence!

## What Did The Commission Suggest?

Several recommendations have been made to streamline the management
and revenue of Communidades and also to amend the Code of
Communidades. But the most important recommendations are on how to
save the Communidade land, what it was originally meant for:

- Communidades are bodies primarily to look after the agrarian aspects
of the society and it should try to recover and divert it for
agriculture. Obtain information of available agricultural land as well
as fallow land and put it for beneficial use.
- Identify Communidade land by superimposing Tombacao plans of
Communidade on the current survey plans of Directorate of Survey and
Land Records.
- Take stringent steps to remove the encroachments from the
Communidade property. Give these powers to the Attorney of the
Communidade to remove encroachments.
- In extreme cases where it is not possible for the Communidade to
remove the encroachers due to some bar of law, Communidade should
regularise it after being compensated for the land lost. But this
should be limited to the cases of collective encroachment by way of
shanties and illegal colonies.
- Government should not acquire Communidade land for public utility
but it should be granted on lease-hold basis with enhancement of rent
so that Communidades will have recurring income.
- Since the Government has no right to liquidate nonfunctional
Communidades, the Administrator of Communidades should act in this
regard and decide about its revival etc on a case-to-case basis.
- Powers should be given for the management of agricultural land not
used or misused by the “tenants”.[^19]

What does the last recommendation mean? Probably it is related to the
resolution passed at the Convention of Communidades held in
October 2013. It was regarding the tenancy issue, which was taken up
as ‘any other business with the permission of the chair’, since it was
not part of the agenda:[^20]

[^19]: Report of Communidade Commission
[^20]: Ibid (Report on Convention of the Communidades)

> “*There was unanimity among the delegates present that the
> Agricultural Tenancy Act 1964 ought not to be applied for
> Communidade lands, as this was the primary evil responsible for the

>

Communidade originated from the *Gaunkari* institution of the original
cultivators, who owned it as community land or a commune. Today, its
members unanimously resolve that the ‘primary evil’ of the present
state of affairs of the Communidade is the Agricultural Tenancy Act,
which gives ownership of cultivated land to the cultivator. They blame
the tenants for selling their cultivated land. But, unfortunately,
neither the Convention of Communidades nor the Communidade Commission
has dug into the fact whether those who claim themselves to be the
tenants are the real cultivators.

Vijay Gawas, a researcher working at the Goa University, has written a
book Human Rights and Indigenous People in Goa. He has interesting
observations to make in this regard:

> “*The Portuguese colonial rulers introduced new legislation to
> control land revenue from the Communidades. But our indigenous
> forefathers were unaware about the new legislation.  Without their
> knowledge, the affluent class registered the land in their own name
> and kept quiet. By the time this trick was realized by the tribals,
> they had lost possession of their own land.  They were asked to pay
> the share of their produce to the new owners... This affluent class
> had adopted a new tactic against the Gawda community called ‘Sugar
> Knife’ (‘Sakharechi Suri’ in Konkani) and the ownership of their
> land was totally removed from their mind... the land remained in the
> possession of tribals, but only as caretakers, not the owners of the
> land. Hence, there was no revolt against the land ownership or
> establishment of tribal rights on the land.*
>
> *Under such circumstances the Goa Tenancy Act and Goa Mundkar Act
> came into existence after liberation of Goa...  the Goa Tenancy
> Act... stated that everyone had the right to cultivate but they
> cannot hold joint titles along with the landlord. When the state
> conducted the first survey, the majority of the tribal people were

> they were paying as rent during Portuguese Colonial Rule. After
> liberation, such tax payment receipts were not recognized by the
> State. These people had to ultimately lose their traditional
> occupation of cultivation of different crops on Communidade
> Land.*”[^21]

[^21]: Gawas Vijay: Impact on tribal people after codification of
*Gaunkary* system into Code of Communidades

Vijay Gawas from Neura hails from the same tribal community, who lost
their cultivated land to the Communidades.  It is worth investigating
by setting up another independent commission how much truth the
allegation holds. Because for those who founded the *Gaunkari* system,
they look at the Communidade as the *Bhatkar* and also find the Tenancy
Act faulty.

## Who is a *Bhumiputra*?

Meanwhile, the Goa Assembly has already passed a Goa Regularisation of
Unauthorized Construction Act in 2016, which legalised all the
unauthorised constructions in its property on or before 28 February
2014, including that of the mundkars. The illegal constructions, which
were legalised, are residential as well as commercial, between 100 to
400 square metres of builtup area.[^22]

At the beginning of this year, Revenue Minister Jennifer Monserrate
told the Goa Assembly that since 2017, the government had received
4066 applications for regularisation, out of which 2018 were
rejected. Only 473 were regularised while others were at the stages of
inspection etc.[^23] By 25 January, the cabinet headed by Dr Pramod
Sawant of the BJP decided to amend the act, in order to regularise
unauthorized construction in orchard and cultivable lands under
Eco-Sensitive Zone-II. The CM said it would ‘help’ in regularising
13,000 more unauthorised houses.[^24] It was introduced on 28 January
and passed the next day.

regularised

And then came the controversial bill, The Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini
bill, which was introduced in the session held on 29 July which
spilled over post-midnight and tabled at 2.12 am. It was bulldozed
through in the next day’s session amidst a walkout by the
opposition. There was a state-wide uproar over the bill due to which
the BJP government had to surrender and stall seeking consent to the
bill from the Governor. Later it was also revealed through RTI that
the bill was objected to even by the revenue, finance, and law
departments.

Goans across party lines objected to the word *Bhumiputra*, which was
explained by CM Dr Sawant as ‘the son of the soil’.  The bill refers
to any person residing in Goa for the last 30 years prior to 1 April
2019 and has no dwelling exceeding the area of 250 square
metres. 

“*The Bill provides for a mechanism to give ownership rights
to the self-occupied dweller of a small housing unit to enable him to
live with dignity and self-respect and exercise his right to life,*”
the bill stated. There was a public uproar that this bill was brought
on the eve of the Assembly election to please the migrant vote
bank. Bowing before the public pressure, the bill is now being frozen.

Dr Madhu Gaude Ghodkirekar, a forensic doctor at Goa Medical College
and a columnist, wrote on the event of International Tribals Day (9
August) that more than "Bhumiputra*, Goans and the government should
respect Bhumi Bhakt (a devotee of Goan soil), who is devoted to
develop Goa.  Incidentally, Dr Madhu belongs to the Gauda community,
one of the first group of settlers in Goa almost 10,000 years
ago.[^25]

No matter what happens to the bill, this has provoked a
debate once again. Who is a *Bhumiputra*? Who should be called
the Son of the Soil? The one who has been living in Goa for
generations but is now conspiring with land sharks and selling
Goa and its precious land for selfish petty gains? Or the one
who has migrated recently but works to preserve and upgrade
Goa, including the hardworking migrant labour? And who is a
migrant? The one who migrated to Goa after liberation or also
the one who had migrated thousands of years ago and grabbed
the land owned by the community of the Mull Goenkar − the
original settlers like Gaudde, Kunbi Velip, Kharvi, Mhar etc.?
