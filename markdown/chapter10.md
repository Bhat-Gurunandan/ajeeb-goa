### Chapter 10
# THE REVOLUTIONARY ELECTION 

Differences within the Congress started coming to the fore with the
beginning of the election process and the releasing of the party
manifestos. The party preferred to play with words on the most
debatable issue of Goa’s merger in order to please both the camps, and
invited wrath from both the sides. On the issue of merger, the
manifesto stated:

> *The Government of India has made it clear that the future of Goa and
> whether it should merge into the adjoining territory of Maharashtra
> will be ultimately decided according to the wishes of the people of
> Goa. For the present this question does not arise as we have to
> stabilise and strengthen the economy and facilitate the changes that
> are taking place because of the integration of Goa in the Indian
> Union.*[^1]

The UGP camp wrote lengthy articles in newspapers, cutting Congress to
the size, by asking varied questions, about Who, When and How? Who are
these people who would decide?  Goans living in Goa or also Goans
living outside Goa? And will Goans living in Goa also include people
from Maharashtra and other states living in Goa? When will this be
decided? Later, means after 5 months? 5 years? 50 years, or more? And
how would it be decided? By means of a plebiscite?[^2]

The Congress kept mum.

On the other hand, *Gomantak* carried the news of the manifesto as an
eight-column headline, claiming that the Congress has finally agreed
to merge Goa into Maharashtra and has left the decision to the people,
linking it directly to the forthcoming election.[^3] The AICC, on the
day the election manifesto was approved in Delhi on 2 October 1963,
had made it clear that the future of Goa would not be an election
issue.[^4] Still, it was made an election issue by the
mergerists. Amidst the confusion, the pro-merger camp within the
Congress dashed off to the national capital and met Nehru, pressing
for immediate decision on the issue of merger. They were furious
because the original draft sent by the manifesto committee chairman
Adv Pandurang Mulgaonkar had been altered by Purushottam Kakodkar by
sending a counter note. His note was included in the manifesto.[^5]
The delegation led by Dr Pundalik Gaitonde included Adv Gopal Apa
Kamat, Anthony D’Souza and Madhav Bir. Due to this, AICC General
Secretary K K Shah came down to Goa on 12 October to pacify the party
functionaries.

While claiming that the confusion has been resolved, Shah
told the media that he also met the MGP and the UGP leaders
and even they were convinced about the stand taken by the
Congress. This enraged the UGP and Dr Jack de Sequeira and
Dr Melicio Fernandes clarified that they had never met Shah
and that they stood by the party’s demand of Statehood for Goa.[^6]

[^6]: The Navhind Times; 19 October 1963

Bhausaheb Bandodkar admitted to having met Shah, but did not disclose
what transpired in the meeting. However, Waman Radhakrishna narrates a
completely different version of this meeting. According to him, Bhau
was kept waiting by Shah at Hotel Mandovi, where he was deliberating
with his party colleagues like Kamat, Mulgaonkar, etc. After a long
wait, he was called inside at the request made by *Gomantak* Editor B D
Satoskar to the Congress leaders. He saw Bhau sitting restlessly in
the lobby and intervened. But Bhau was apparently furious. He told
Shah and the local Congress leaders that he had come there with a plan
to join their party, but now he has changed his mind after the
humiliating treatment he received from the local and national Congress
leaders.[^7]

[^7]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; मुक्तीनंतरचा गोवा, पान 18

During this visit, Goa’s leading mine owners like Shantilal
Khushaldas, Vasudev Salgaoncar, Pandurang Timble and Dempo also met
Shah.

On the other hand, the PSP leaders from Maharashtra started pressing
for the immediate merger of Goa into Maharashtra, which embarrassed
the Congress further.

## Congress Embraces The Mighty *Bhatkars*

While the manifesto controversy was dying down, another big
controversy arose with the Central Parliamentary Board releasing the
first list of the Congress candidates on 30 October 1963. Prominent
among them was Goa’s biggest mine owner and landlord Vaicuntrao Dempo,
who was allocated a ticket from Pernem. There were also some small
landlords chosen to be the candidates, contrary to what Nehru had
announced during his Goa visit. Also, cleverly, some of the mergerists
were allotted constituencies over which they had no hold while the
anti-mergerists had comfortable constituencies for them.

The other candidates included 18 freedom fighters: Lucio Rodrigues
(Siolim), Dr Jose Francisco Martins (Aldona), Atmaram Karmalkar
(Mapusa), Mitra Bir (Tivim), Gopal Apa Kamat (Bicholim), Pandurang
Mulgaonkar (Pale), Jaykrishna Shirodkar (Sanguem), Dr Vinayak Mayenkar
(Ponda), Ravindra Kelekar (Madkai), Shankar Sardesai (Shiroda), Alvaro
Pereira (St Estevam), Anthony D’Souza (Panaji), Tukaram Kankonkar (St
Cruz), Dattatray Deshpande (Mormugao), Ligorio Cota Carvalho
(Cortalim), Laxmikant Bhembre (Margao), Joao Cabral (Curtorim),
Purushottam Kakodkar (Curchorem) and Dr Ram Hegde (Quepem).[^8]

The list also included other candidates like Shivram Azgaonkar
(Mandrem), Rudolph D’Mello (Calangute), Baburao Hirbarao Desai
(Sattari), Maria Elvina Pinto Menezes (St Andre), Irene Barros
(Benaulim), Irene Fereira (Cuncolim), Bernardo do Reis (Navelim) and
Shivram Fondu Naik Desai (Canacona).[^9]

The real shock to the Congressmen was Vaicuntrao
Dempo, who did not fit the criteria laid down by the party to
choose candidates. *Gomantak*, in its editorial, tore into the
Congress party. B D Satoskar pointed out that the pro-mergerist
candidates were allotted seats contrary to their choice of the
constituency they had mentioned in the application form.
Secondly, he observed that the major criteria of participation in
the Goa independence movement had been blatantly violated by
allotting tickets to the opportunist bootlickers of the Portuguese.
He also alleged that the Congress had accommodated them in
the party fold in order to prevent them from joining the UGP.[^10]
(This clearly suggested that Goa’s *Bhatkars* were rallying around
the UGP.)

Though neither *Gomantak* nor any other prominent daily had named anyone
in particular, it was crystal clear that the prime target was
Dempo. It was also because he had been elected as one of the three
Deputados (Member of Parliament) in the Portuguese Parliament for a
four-year term from 1961 to 1965, before Liberation.[^11] `The history
of the loyalty of the Dempo family with the Portuguese was an open
book. His great grandfather Guiridora, known fondly as Guiri-bab, was

> “honoured by the Portuguese with a title, Cavalier of the Land for
> Valour, Loyalty and Merit" in 1869. Another illustrious Dempo
> forefather was Guiri-bab’s nephew, Rayu-bab. It was he who was
> decorated with a baronetcy by the Portuguese (Barao, baron in
> Portuguese).”[^12]

The reaction this time was more antagonistic. Within five days, 18
prominent Congressmen resigned from the party’s primary membership in
protest of the selection of candidates, including two candidates:
Anthony D’Souza (also the GPCC Secretary) and Dr Ram Hegde. Their
resignation letters stated that the Parliamentary Board had betrayed
the basic aspirations of the people of Goa, bypassing the pledge of
socialism and the ultimate goal of the merger; and that the election
made the battle easier for the established reactionary and
anti-national forces. The letter also hinted at tickets being allotted
to those who were in good books with the Portuguese establishment till
yesterday.

The other 16 members who resigned were GPCC vice president Narayan
Naik, the President of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry Madhavrao
Talaulikar, businessmen Bhagwant Naik, Damodar Kashinath Naik and
Prabhakar Angle, Adv Vishwanath Lawande, Dattaram Desai, Punaji
Achrekar, Manju Gaonkar, Zotico D’Souza, M S Prabhu, A S Naik,
Shrirang Karmali, Tulshidas Malkarnekar, Prabhakar Ghodge and even
Madhav Bir, whose wife Mitra was allotted the ticket from Tivim.

Shah had to rush down to Goa within a month, on 9 November, hardly two
days before the former union home minister Lal Bahadur Shastri was
scheduled to launch the election campaign. He along with Mohan Dharia
and G B Nevalkar succeeded in working out an amicable solution to try
and end the crisis. But only half of the protesters withdrew their
resignations after exchanging their constituencies.

Accordingly, Madhav Bir was given the ticket in Tivim instead of his
wife Mitra and Anthony D’Souza withdrew from the fray, paving the way
for Alvaro Pereira to shift from St Estevam to Panaji. The other
exchanges were Laxmikant Bhembre from Margao to Sanguem, Jaikrishna
Shirodkar from Sanguem to Madkai, Ravindra Kelekar from Madkai to
Margao, Shankar Sardesai from Shiroda to St Estevam and Dr Ram Hegde
from Quepem to Shiroda. Anthony D’Souza and Tulshidas Malkarnekar
declared that they would work for the party. Businessmen Madhavrao
Talalulkar, Damodar Kashinath Naik, and Bhagwant Naik also withdrew
their resignations.

Meanwhile, the Bombay MGM publicly appealed to all those who had
resigned to join the MGP, Goa. Accordingly, the remaining nine
including Prabhakar Angle joined the MGP. Four of them were given
tickets by the MGP: Punaji Acharekar from Calangute, Narayan Naik from
Panaji, Vishwanath Lawande from St Andre, and Dattaram Desai from
Quepem. Interestingly, except for Dattaram Desai, the other three
neo-MGP stalwarts lost the battle to the UGP candidates. Zotica
D’Souza, M S Prabhu, A S Naik, and Shrirang Karmali did not contest,
but joined the MGP.

The Congress list was further modified twice. In Canacona, Shivram
Fondu Naik Desai was replaced by Ganaba Desai.  Moreover, Dr Vinayak
Mayenkar was shifted from Ponda to Quepem to accommodate mine owner
and landlord Madhavrao Talaulikar. The much bigger blow to the
Congress was the dropping of Shivram Azgaonkar, perhaps the only
Scheduled Caste candidate, to give the ticket of Mandrem to Raoraje
Deshprabhu, yet another pro-Portuguese mighty landlord, who would
often proudly display the honorific Portuguese title of Visconde de
Pernem conferred upon the family of Porobo Dessai since 1893. During
the Republic, in the 1919 election when Luis de Menezes Braganza had
led the Boycott Election campaign, Vasudev Porobo Desai Deshprabhu was
one of the government-backed candidates elected to the Legislative
Council from the New Conquests.[^13]

[^13]: Pais e Martins Sharmila; The Encounter with the Ballot in
Colonial Goa (1821-1961) P 184/250

These developments, perhaps at the behest of Purushottam Kakodkar,
caused a distancing of the Nehru-loving Goans from the
Congress. Murmurs began among the masses about the economic background
of the Congress candidates. No doubt the party had a maximum number of
freedom fighters, but most of them were also Saraswat Brahmins and
quite a few landlords.  Comparatively, hardly five candidates belonged
to the non- Brahmin Bahujan Samaj.

## Bhau Enters The Poll Fray

With tickets being given to the big *Bhatkars*, mine owners and
pro-Portuguese elements, the disappointed political activists had
started gathering around the MGP as well as the UGP. It is not true
that Bhau Bandodkar, the MGP president by then, did not want to
contest elections. In fact his was the first candidature announced by
the party: the Lok Sabha ticket from the Panaji (North Goa)
constituency.

Later on, this man, having little political ambition, compromised his
own seat to strike a pre-poll alliance with the Praja Socialist
Party. The Panaji Lok Sabha seat was won by Peter Alvares of the
PSP. Similarly, in Sattari and Ponda, the MGP decided to support the
PSP candidates. Jaisingrao Venkatrao Rane and Gajanan Raikar were
elected.

Bhau and his charged cadres started choosing candidates from among the
Bahujan Samaj. Most of them were unknown faces beyond their villages
or constituencies. They were young or middle-aged teachers, lawyers,
small traders, other professionals and even illiterate farmers, either
from the middle class or lower middle class. Compared to the Congress
candidates, only nine of the MGP candidates were freedom fighters: P P
Shirodkar (Siolim), Shambhu Palienkar (Tivim), Narayan Naik (St Cruz),
Vishwanath Lawande (St Andre), Vasant Velingkar (Madkai), Tony
Fernandes (Sanguem), Dattaram Desai (Quepem), Vithal Subray Karmali
(Curchorem) and Venkatesh Verenkar (Cortalim).  Six among them won the
election. Narayan Naik, Vishwanath Lawande, and Venkatesh Verenkar did
not make it.

Similarly, an impression was created that the MGP was an anti-Brahmin
party. But Bhau and his associates had chosen almost eight Saraswat
Brahmins, who were progressive in their thoughts and firmly believed
in the Land to the Tiller demand.  Some of them were even small
*Bhatkars* in their ancestral villages. These included Atchutrao
Usgaonkar (Pale), Govind Dhume (Panaji), Vishwanath Lawande (St
Andre), Mukund Shinkre (Ponda), V S Karmali (Curchorem), Ranganath
Santu Kamat (Navelim), Govind Prabhu (Cuncolim) and Vishwambhar Salkar
(Mormugao). Usgaonkar and Karmali among them were elected while
Shinkre was elected as the South Goa MP after the Ponda seat was
allotted to the PSP.

Two among them were Christians, Minguel Rodrigues (Benaulim) and Tony
Fernandes (Sanguem), also a freedom fighter who was elected. The MGP
had also fielded Ashraf Aga from Sattari, but he was unofficially
withdrawn after the MGPPSP alliance was struck. Despite this, the
popular Aga polled 29 per cent votes, next to the winner Jaisingrao
Rane of the PSP, their own ally.

But the most important and unique characteristic of the MGP, unlike
the Congress or the UGP, was that 19 of their total 27 candidates were
from the Bahujan Samaj and 17 among them did not carry any additional
label as a freedom fighter or being a Christian or a Muslim. They were
common men, chosen from the masses.

In fact, the most interesting anecdote shared with me was by Adv
Ramakant Khalap, who succeeded Bhau in Mandrem after his sudden death
in 1973. He went to meet former MGP MLAs to seek their blessings and
this is what Kashinath Shetgaonkar, the Pernem MLA in the first
Assembly and an uneducated farmer, told him:

> *“I was ploughing my field and a jeep suddenly stopped near the
> bandh. Two men got down, called me, and told that Bhau Bandodkar had
> called me to Panaji. I had heard of Bhau but had never met him
> personally. Wondering why I was suddenly called, I went home, changed
> my clothes and sat in the jeep.  When I was introduced to Bhau, he
> told me that I would be the MGP candidate. It was an absolute surprise
> to me when he told me that I would have to fight against Vaicuntrao
> Dempo, Goa’s mighty landlord and a mine owner. Hesitantly, I
> surrendered to Bhau’s insistence. Never in my life I had contested any
> election, even the recently held Panchayat election. But when we
> started moving around, I was utterly astonished with the response we
> were getting. And then, I was declared elected, polling almost half of
> the votes. Dempo could poll only one third. We had defeated the
> Bhatkar.*”

## *Bhatkars* Ride Over The UGP

Diametrically opposite to this was the scenario in the UGP.  The
*Bhatkar* community of Goa was rallying around the UGP by riding the
wave of keeping Goa separate, preserving the Konkani language, and
defeating Nehru’s Congress as well as the Hindu Bahujan Samaj. The
party contested 24 seats out of 28 in Goa. No candidates were fielded
in four constituencies of the New Conquests: Pernem, St Estevam,
Madkai, and Shiroda.

Among these, 16 were Christians, seven Hindus and one Muslim, Shaikh
Kadar (Curchorem). Also, 10 among them were upper caste Brahmins
including four Hindu *Bhatkars* as well as seven from Chardo (Kshatriya)
community including Tatoba Rane, a Hindu Khashe, from Sattari. Almost
12 among them were wealthy *Bhatkars* from both the religions. All the
16 constituencies of Christian-dominated Old Conquests were
represented by wealthy *Bhatkars* from Brahmin or Chardo
communities. Only four among them were freedom fighters: John M de
Souza (Calangute), Shivaji Dubhashi (Bicholim), Cristovao Furtado from
Chinchinim (Sanguem), and Enio Pimenta (Curtorim).

Former independent MLA and political analyst Adv Radharao Gracias
tells me that it was a tradition in the 1960s and ‘70s that elections
were contested by educated and rich people. The lower class
Christians, especially from the Sudir community, never ever dreamt of
contesting elections. Perhaps this could be the impact of the
Portuguese system where only Portuguese-speaking upper class persons
who could pay three times more tax than the common men (not women)
were eligible to contest elections to the Portuguese Parliament, Goa
Legislative Council, or the Camara Municipal.

The wealthy *Bhatkars* included Alvaro da Loyola Furtado, Dr Jack de
Sequeira, Maurelio Furtado, Urminda Lima Leitao, Orlando Lobo, Dr Luis
Proto Barbosa, Enio Pimenta, John de Souza as well as Vasudev
Sarmalkar, Sadashiv Desai, Tatoba Rane, and Shivaji Dubhashi.

The UGP, till it existed, was always supported by Christians at large
as well as the Brahmin *Bhatkars* from the Hindu community, even in the
New Conquests. MGP activists like my father and some of his associates
in Canacona, who were also Brahmin *Bhatkars*, were humiliated by other
Brahmin *Bhatkars* who were dead against the MGP policy of Land to the
Tiller.

My father and a small group who were campaigning among the illiterate
farmers not to give more than one-sixth of their produce to the
*Bhatkar* after the Land to the Tiller Act was enforced, were dubbed as
‘Latan Sabha’, as they were carrying a lantern to move from house to
house. Later on, these Hindu Brahmin *Bhatkars* shifted to the Congress
when the UGP split into the Janata Party and the Congress. Now, the
majority of them are with the BJP. Politically, they opposed the
merger, supported Konkani but used only Marathi even in the temple
administration, where they are the Mahajans. For them, perhaps, the
prime agenda was Land to the Tiller linked to the threat of merger and
not the language controversy.

## Communists In Disguise

The Communists in Goa, who were mainly involved in trade union
activities in the port town of Vasco as well as the mining belt at
that time, were also a force to reckon with, besides the
Congress. Even before the MGP and the UGP came into being, they had
been working among the peasants, having formed the Shetkari Paksh
(Farmers’ Party).[^14] However, they did not contest with their Communist
symbols but came together as a political front, called Frente
Popular. It was a tactical strategy since the people, especially the
Christian community, were under the influence of the Church, for whom
the Communists were Enemy Number One.

Though they contested only eight seats, the candidates were true
stalwarts who had played a pioneering role in the freedom struggle and
were working among the masses even after Goa’s independence. They were
Berta Menezes Braganza (Cortalim), Gerald Pereira (Mormugao), George
Vaz (Tivim), Narayan Desai (Pernem), Divakar Kakodkar (Curchorem),
Chandrakant Kakodkar (Sanguem), Vithal Parab (Mandrem), and J P
Braganza (St Cruz).

In spite of having a clear-cut agenda of ‘Land to the Tiller’ as well
as problems of the working class of Goa, their selfless work did not
get translated into votes. The party could not garner more than two
per cent votes. The only ‘Comrades’ who could get a little public
support were Narayan Desai in Pernem (21%) and Gerald Pereira in
Mormugao (19%).

When I was working fulltime in Vasco for Naujawan Bharat Sabha and was
moving from house to house in our struggle to legalise the so-called
illegal houses of the working class in the port town, I heard a common
tale about Gerald Pereira’s election battle in 1963. This simple but
intelligent man moving on his feet throughout the constituency was
invited by the people to address election meetings in their areas
rather than the Frente Popular mobilising the people. He enjoyed so
much overwhelming support that his victory was a foregone
conclusion. The polling day, 9 December 1963, was a Monday.

[^14]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; मुक्तीनंतरचा गोवा, पान 18

The Sunday Mass held the previous day changed the whole picture
overnight. Urminda Lima Leitão e Mascarenhas, a mine owner and a
landlord, was elected the UGP MLA by polling 3209 votes. Comrade
Pereira was pushed down to the third position, with only 1612 votes!

## The Shinkre Controversy

It is not the Congress alone that faced a rebellion, but also the
MGP. In fact, the party lost their leader, Janardan Shinkre, who had
founded the party. He developed serious differences with Bandodkar on
the issue of aligning with the PSP. Since the whole local leadership
was new and PSP had expertise in electioneering as well as politically
experienced workers, Bandodkar accepted the proposal made by PSP
leader S M Joshi to offer them one Lok Sabha seat and four Assembly
seats. In return, the PSP offered to manage MGP’s whole election
campaign. Bhau sacrificed his own Lok Sabha seat to Peter Alvares from
Panaji (North Goa) and brought down the proposal to two Assembly
seats: Jaisingrao Rane (Sattari) and Gajanan Raikar
(Ponda). Immediately, Mukund Shinkre, who was contesting the Assembly
poll from Ponda, was fielded as the Lok Sabha candidate from Mormugao
(South Goa).[^15]

[^15]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; मुक्तीनंतरचा गोवा, पान 23

MGP General Secretary Janardan Shinkre did not agree with this
deal. He was also upset because Ashraf Aga was not fielded from Ponda
but shifted to Sattari and then out of the fray due to the PSP
candidate. In protest, he filed his nomination for Lok Sabha from
Panaji, as a dummy candidate to Bhau. It meant that if Bhau withdrew,
Janardan could then contest as the official MGP candidate. While Bhau
was authorised by the party to decide the candidates, the B Forms of
party candidates had to be issued by Shinkre. Bhau immediately moved
into action, withdrew Shinkre’s powers to issue B Forms and declared
on 18 November 1963 that the MGP had snapped ties with Shinkre.[^16]
Interestingly, as an independent candidate, Shinkre was allotted for
the Lok Sabha election the symbol of ‘Two Leaves’, which later on in
the Opinion Poll was the symbol for anti-merger. He forfeited his
deposit by polling just 3226 votes from the whole of North Goa.

However, this last minute controversy over the alliance created a few
problems for the MGP-PSP combine. The official Assembly candidates of
the PSP − Rane and Raikar − had to contest as Independent candidates,
on different symbols. But the alliance managed to turn the pro-merger
votes in their favour and win both the seats.

The only PSP candidates who could withdraw from the fray were P P
Pednekar (Siolim), Parulekar (Calangute), Shantaram Dhond (Aldona),
and Namdev Haldankar (Mapusa). The other eight candidates remained on
the paper as Independent candidates, polling negligible votes. They
were Bhanudas Pollji (Mandrem), Vishwas Desai (Pernem), Shivaji Desai
(Pale), Shantu [Satudatt] Pal (Bicholim), Pandurang Rane (Tivim),
Madhu Shirodkar (St Andre), Mukund Mortu Shet (St Estevam), and
Rajaram B Gaonkar (Madkai).

S M Joshi, a towering personality among the socialists in Maharashtra,
not only came for the election campaign but sent his entire team to
work behind the curtains for the MGP-PSP alliance.

[^16]: गोमंतक; 19 नोव्हेंबर 1963

## National Leaders & Regional Media

Despite this, the MGP campaign remained a low-key affair since no
Maharashtra leader, except Socialists S M Joshi, Madhu Dandavate, and
Barrister Nath Pai came down for their campaign. The heart and soul of
the Maharashtra Congress leaders was with the MGP, but they could not
publicly identify with the party and thus stayed away from the Goa
campaign.

In fact a controversy broke out in Goa when Maharashtra’s
influential revenue minister Vasantrao Naik, who later became
Maharashtra chief minister, came to Goa with the campaign
material for the Congress but stayed at Bandodkar’s bungalow.
GPCC President Purushottam Kakodkar objected to it in the
party meeting, raising suspicion over the Maharashtra Congress
leaders secretly supporting the MGP. Naik however dismissed
it, claiming that Bandodkar was his ‘personal friend’.[^17]

[^17]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; मुक्तीनंतरचा गोवा, पान 23

Except for the PSP factor, the MGP as well as the UGP stressed more
upon corner meetings in the localities and direct contact with the
people. Goa was politically divided between the Old and the New
Conquests. The MGP was pulling in crowds in the New Conquests while
most of the people in the Old Conquests were fired up by the emotional
speeches made, in Konkani, by the UGP leaders.

But none of these meetings were getting the publicity they deserved in
the mainstream media of Goa. *The Navhind Times*, whose owner Vaicuntrao
Dempo was the Congress candidate, had blacked out both the local
parties. It was only about the Congress, Congress, and Congress,
except for a few mentions of the MGP or the UGP when some political
developments took place.

Similar was the case with A Vida, a Portuguese-English- Romi Konkani
daily published from Margao. The owner, Bernardo Do Reis, was
contesting as a Congress candidate from Navelim. His daily was filled
with news of Congress meetings, detailed profiles of the Congress
candidates, and a little news about the UGP or the articles written by
its leaders. But not a single line covering the MGP’s election
campaign.

I was always under the impression that the MGP had with it Goa’s
leading Marathi daily *Gomantak* to publicise its views since B D
Satoskar, the editor, was a strong proponent of the merger. But
*Gomantak* had also blacked out the MGP, except when the PSP leaders
from Maharashtra addressed the public rallies. Some mentions in
single-column one-paragraph news reports were sometimes found, about
the public meetings held by the MGP. *Gomantak*, owned by another mine
owner, Chowgule, appears to have had a policy similar to *The Navhind
Times*: Congress, Congress, and more Congress!

The mining lobby of Goa also made attempts to create hurdles in the
MGP campaign. Bandodkar was extracting the ore and supplying it to the
registered exporter, who was a mine owner. This mine owner suddenly
began to delay Bandodkar’s payment, as Bhau was utilising this money
for the election campaign. M S Prabhu, who was Goa’s leading insurance
agent, had received Rs 40,000 as his commission. He used this towards
the campaign expenses. However, at the local level, the finances were
managed by the party workers from their own pocket. The MGP had no
financial burden of organising the local meetings, so much was the
commitment of the villagers.[^18]

[^18]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; महाराष्ट्रवादी गोमंतक, स्थापना आणि वाटचाल, पान 25

There is one incident which Waman Radhakrishna narrates in his
book. Bandodkar and Barrister Nath Pai were delayed for a meeting in a
certain village in the interior Goa. It was totally dark when they
reached the village road. Electricity had not reached the villages at
that time. Nath Pai suggested that the meeting be cancelled since
there wouldn’t be any crowd. Bhau insisted that the people would be
waiting. And suddenly they saw a group of around 200 villagers coming
to the main road, with chood (a torch made of coconut leaves) in their
hands, to receive their leaders. Nath Pai was flabbergasted with this
gesture and support. It was all happening very spontaneously.  Similar
was the enthusiasm in the UGP camp, especially in the Old
Conquests. People were scared that they would become part of
Maharashtra and that after the Portuguese had left yet another
‘foreign’ language would be imposed upon them.

The Congress, a seasoned party in electioneering, was far ahead of
both these parties. They were pouring in money, getting experienced
cadres from outside for election management and wide
publicity. Special teams of senior journalists were brought down from
Maharashtra and Delhi for select public rallies. A pageant of national
leaders and union ministers was lined up in Goa to woo all kinds of
crowds: Hindus, Christians, peasants, workers, migrants etc. Some of
them camped in Goa till the campaign ended. The election campaign was
launched by former union home minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on 11
November 1963. He came back once again to conclude the campaign in the
first week of December, addressing meetings in the villages.

Congress stalwarts among them were Congress President D Sanjivayya
along with Maniben Desai, former Orissa chief minister Biju Patnaik,
former union ministers Jagjivan Ram, Morarji Desai, Y B Chavan, S K
Patil, Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairperson Violet Alva, her husband and MP
Joachim Alva, Mohan Dharia, Kerala Congress leader Dr Henry Austin
Fernandes, P K Sawant etc. While each leader was pleading not to make
Goa’s merger an election issue, Christian leaders like Fernandes and
Alvas were asking Goans not to mix religion with politics. They were
not just going to the cities but even visiting the villages, from
Pernem to Salcete to Bicholim.

The most interesting among these were two meetings held in Pernem and
Mandrem, from where mighty landlords like Vaicuntrao Dempo and Raoraje
Deshprabhu were contesting. Sanjivayya, at a meeting held in Pernem,
tried to impress the crowd claiming that Vaicuntrao Dempo has been the
supporter of Congress for a long time and how his contribution to the
liberation movement was praiseworthy. He also called it ‘mischievous’
to say that the Congress had betrayed the cause of socialism by giving
tickets to the landlords and industrialists like Dempo.[^19]

[^19]: The Navhind Times; 5 December 1963

There was a reason for Sanjivayya to reach to this level to
convince the Pernem voters. A fortnight before this, K K Shah
had been cornered by the voters when he visited Pernem and
Mandrem along with the Lok Sabha and Assembly candidates
to meet his party workers. Hearing the news, around a thousand
Pednekars gathered at the meeting venue and Shah had no other
option but to reply to their blunt questions, in Pernem as well
as in Mandrem:

*How is it that you have given tickets to landlords and
capitalists when your profession is that you are working for the
poor?*

Shah
: *We adopted such people as candidates in India, also in other
states. But we got them bound to our principles and programme. We told
them that they must subscribe to tenancy legislation and other
legislation which sought to ameliorate the conditions of workers in
factories. That is the way Congress wants to bring in the Socialist
pattern by stages.*

T V Parvate
: *Deshprabhu and Dempo are wedded to the Congress programme which
stands for improving the standard of life of the peasants and
workers. In fact Deshprabhu has already granted reasonable rent and
security to the peasants, even before Congress brought this
legislation.*

Dempo
: *I stand by the programme of the Congress to work for Socialism and
to satisfy people’s basic necessities like food, clothing and
shelter. I will personally work for it.*

Deshprabhu
: *I have nothing new to tell you. You should take into consideration
the services of the Congress to India during the last 75 years and
particularly during the last 16 years and decide for yourselves that
under Congress rule you would be happy.*[^20]

[^20]: The Navhind Times; 23 November 1963

Neither Dempo nor Deshprabhu stood by the socialist programme of the
Congress. In fact, even after the Tenancy and Mundkar Acts were
enforced during the MGP regime, over three-fourth of Pernem and its
villages still belong to the Deshprabhus. I am told that the tenants
still give Khand to the mighty *Bhatkar* and a receipt is issued to
them. The reason is simple. To extend the existing house or to build a
new house, the common Pednekar needs to obtain an NOC from the
landowner, just as the Sattari people need to do with the land
belonging to the Khashe or the Government. The whole land of Pernem
still belongs to the *Bhatkars* even after 60 years of Goa’s
independence. They have sold it to the North Indian hoteliers in the
coastal belt, and our own Goan politicians have bought land around the
proposed Mopa airport.

Coming back to the campaign of 1963, it was a sheer coincidence that
when Sanjivayya was facing flak from the farmers of Pernem due to
Dempo and Deshprabhu’s candidatures, Maharashtra-based Congress leader
Yeshwantrao Chavan was greeted by the farmers in areas like Bicholim
and other places.  He was the icon of Goan farmers due to the
revolutionary land reforms he had enforced as the first CM of
Maharashtra. He was blunt enough to accept the factual position and
provide practical solutions to the voters. ln his first rally in Vasco
he said:

> *“I liken the Goa election to the churning of the sea by the Gods and
> the Demons. Just as from that churning emerged the 14 precious jewels
> including the world-consuming poison, some less vitriolic poison may
> emerge from this election also.  But just as Shankar was found to
> arrest its spread, the Congress can scotch this poison too.”*

Whether in Vasco or Panaji, Chavan had to face slogans on
the merger issue. But in Bicholim, thousands of people welcomed
him by shouting pro-merger slogans. In response, he told the
crowd that if and when Goa had to be merged, it would only
be in Maharashtra. But the time is not now, you are not going to
have a referendum on that point in this election, he said.

Chavan argued the case of ‘Why Congress’ in his own style. He felt the
Congress should be elected to power with a clear majority to foil the
demand of a separate State by the United Goans Party. They are not
only Christians but also have ‘some Hindus’ with them, he
said. According to him, a separate state at this juncture was a
dangerous move. In his Panaji rally, he had termed it as an attempt to
create a ‘Black Portugal’. He had also assured them full freedom to
practice their western culture, music, clothing, food and way of life.

But the real master stroke was what he said in Bicholim, tilting his
argument in favour of the MGP:

> *“I have heard it said that Congress must be returned to power in order
> to avail of central aid for development. I am against this spirit of
> bargaining. Development funds for Goa will be there even if it
> continues to be a Union Territory directly governed by the Centre or
> even if, in this election, the Congress government does not come to
> power…”*[^21]

The impact of Chavan’s visit was so much that Shah finally took the
mergerists head on at a meeting in Calangute, a day before the
polling. He reached Calangute at around 7 pm, when a meeting of the
mergerists was going on, while his meeting was scheduled 15 minutes
later. The mergerists asked him to address the same meeting as a
friendly gesture and Shah jumped at it. (The newspaper report does not
state if it was the MGP meeting). While justifying the stand taken by
the Congress on maintaining Goa as the Union Territory and assuring Rs
100 Crore for its development if Congress is brought to power, he
asked the audience:

> *“Whose advice are you going to take? Mr Yeshwantrao Chavan’s or Mr
> Dayanand Bandodkar’s"?*

*The Navhind Times*, who published this incident with this question
itself as a headline, reported that the audience shouted: “*Of course,
Mr Chavan!*”

## Congress Routed, MGP-UGP Rise

And then came D-Day, 9 December 1963, to decide on Chavan or
Bandodkar. The response was much more than the Panchayat
elections. Over 75 per cent Goans exercised their franchise all across
Goa, with women outnumbering men as voters. Long queues were witnessed
practically at every booth and Lt Governor Mulk Raj Sachdev personally
monitored the election by visiting the polling booths all around Goa.

The counting began three days later, on 12 December, and ended the
next day. By midnight, 15 results were declared, spreading a wave of
panic in the Congress camp and making the UGP jubilant. The Congress
had not won a single seat in Goa, except one in Daman. The UGP had won
nine seats, the MGP took four, and one by an independent in Diu. Dr
Jack de Sequeira was the first victor announced in the history of
Goa’s first democratic election. In a close encounter, he had defeated
MGP candidate Govind Dhume by 414 votes and polled 42 per cent
votes. Congress candidate Alvaro Pereira could somehow manage to save
his deposit but could not garner more than 21 per cent votes.

This was the scenario at all the 13 seats of which results were
declared. Almost nine Congressmen among them had forfeited their
deposits. Except in Mandrem and St Andre, Congress was pushed to the
third position in all other constituencies. Eminent freedom fighters
like Shankar Sardesai (St Estevam, 641 votes) and Ravindra Kelekar
(Madgao, 1113 votes) lost miserably, besides A Vida owner Bernardo do
Reis (Navelim, 750 votes) and Irene Barros (Benaulim, 1711 votes). The
only person who lost honourably was Vishwanath Lawande (St Andre), in
a close fight, by 112 votes.

The UGP winners were Dr Jack Sequeira (Panaji), Dr Álvaro Loyola dá
Furtado (Navelim), Joaquim Arauzo (St Cruz), Vasudev Sarmalkar
(Madgao), Maurelio Furtado (Benaulim), Teotónio Pereira (St Andre),
Sebastiao Mazarelo (Cuncolim), Enio Pimenta (Curtorim) and John M
D’Souza (Calangute).

But it was not a disappointment for the MGP camp at all. In fact, on
the first day itself, the party of the Bahujan Samaj had created
history in Goa’s electoral politics. In two constituencies of Pernem
taluka, three mighty landlords were defeated miserably by two common
men. Vaicuntrao Sinai Dempo (Congress), the landlord and Goa’s leading
mine owner, lost by polling only one third of votes (1912) while
Kashinath Shetgaonkar, an illiterate farmer, polled half of the votes
(3185).  Similarly, Raoraje Deshprabhu, the *Visconde de Pernem*, was
pushed down to the third position. He could not manage to get more
than 14 per cent votes (1410). Sadhashiv Desai (UGP), another
landlord, also could not garner more than 15 per cent votes
(1536). Vijay Kamulkar, a teacher, won with a huge margin of over 5000
votes, by polling 65 per cent votes (6663). Indian democracy had shown
its real shining colours!

Besides these, MGP’s leader P P Shirodkar (Siolim) and Dattaram
Chopdekar (St Estevam) were also declared victorious.  The next day
brought shame to the Congress. The MGP became the first ruling party
of Goa and the UGP became the prime opposition. The Congress could not
win a single seat. The UGP won three more, taking its tally to 12. The
MGP-PSP swept the poll, adding 12 more seats to its kitty. With 16
seats out of 30, the Lion was all set to rule Goa, Daman and Diu. The
UGP got all its 12 seats from the Old Conquests (15 seats). Besides
winning all the 13 seats in the New Conquests, the MGP-PSP combine
also won three seats from Bardez: Siolim, Tivim and Mapusa.

All the dreams of the Congress were shattered. The only respite was
one seat, that too from Daman, which was won by Kalidas Patel (7237)
in a straight fight by polling 81 per cent votes. The whole ‘secret
exercise’ of distributing cabinet berths amongst themselves had gone
in vain. Forget winning a seat, nearly two third of their 28
candidates in Goa, 19 to be precise, lost their deposits. The politics
of embracing royal landlords and mine owners had boomeranged
royally. The pan-India formula of ‘accommodative politics’ of the
Congress had proved to be a big flop in Goa, which Nehru had once
called a pimple on the face of India!

The Diu seat was won by an independent, Mamadali Ravji (1745), by
defeating the Congress-supported Independent Puspasen Wandas
(1373). Interestingly, the battle in Diu was between four
independents, without a single party officially contesting there. In a
four-cornered fight, Mamadali became the MLA by polling only 33 per
cent votes. The other two Independents Ramji Anjani and Gokal Patel
polled 1317 and 844 votes respectively.

The additional 10 seats won by the MGP on the second day were
Raghunath Tople (Mapusa), Shambhu Palienkar (Tivim), Kusumakar Kadkade
(Bicholim), Atchut Usgaonkar (Pale), Vasant Velingkar (Madkai),
Pundalik Sagun Naik (Shiroda), Tony Fernandes (Sanguem), Ganaba Desai
(Canacona), Dattaram Desai (Quepem) and Vithal Subray Karmali
(Curchorem).

The UGP won three more seats: Orlando Lobo (Aldona),
Dr Luis Proto Barbosa (Cortalim) and Urminda Lima Leitao
Mascarenhas (Mormugao).

The MGP-PSP combine had also won both the Lok Sabha seats. Peter
Alvares (53%) of the PSP had defeated the sitting MP and one of the
most eminent freedom fighters Dr Pundalik Gaitonde (16%) of the
Congress as well as Umakant Surlakar (29%) of the UGP. Janardan
Shinkre, who had revolted against Bhau, polled only 3226 votes − three
per cent!

Mukund Shinkre (39%), who was shifted for the Lok Sabha contest at the
last minute due to a tie-up with the PSP was also declared victorious
in a tough battle against A D Loyola Furtado (36%) of the UGP. The
margin was just 3000 votes. Eminent freedom fighter Laura D’Souza
(18%) of the Congress was pushed to third position. This was the first
and last victory for the MGP from South Goa. The seat was then won by
the UGP, Congress, and even the BJP, but never again by the MGP.

## The Winners & The Losers

The winners of the MGP in the Assembly poll included two Saraswat
Brahmins: Atchut Usgaonkar (Pale) and Vithal Subray alias ViSu Karmali
(Curchorem), one Christian - Tony Fernandes (Sanguem), and the rest
belonging to the non-Brahmin Bahujan Samaj. Though Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru later claimed that the election had taken place on
religious lines, the MGP winners belonged to all the three sections,
including progressiveminded Brahmins who supported land reforms. In
fact, Tony Fernandes was elected from Sanguem, where the Christian
population was just 25 per cent. He polled 58 per cent votes.

The UGP established its mark in the Old Conquests.  The ‘Party of
Christians and Hindu Brahmins’ won 12 seats of Calangute, Aldona,
Panaji, St Cruz, St Andre, Cuncolim, Benaulim, Navelim, Margao,
Curtorim, Cortalim, and Mormugao.

Except for Teotonio Pereira, the Mapusa-based bus operator belonging
to the Sudir caste, all other 11 MLAs of the UGP belonged to either
Bamonn or Chardo castes, nine of whom were also wealthy *Bhatkars*,
including Vasudev Sarmalkar from Margao. In a bastion of Hindu and
Christian Brahmins, Vasudevbab polled 51 per cent votes.


1963: GOA ASSEMBLY POLL

| PARTY              | CANDIDATES | VOTES  |
|--------------------|------------|--------|
| MGP-PSP            | 29         | 119788 |
| UGP                | 24         | 74081  |
| Cong               | 29         | 41727  |
| Frente Popular     | 8          | 4589   |
| PSP ‘Independents’ | 8          | 410    |
| Other Independents | 51         | 16603  |
| TOTAL              |            | 257198 |

*Note:*
1. *MGP candidates include Ashraf Aga (Sattari) & Mukund Shinkre
(Ponda), who were withdrawn later in support of PSP candidates
Jaisingrao Rane (Sattari) & Gajanan Raikar (Ponda). MGP did not field
candidates in Curtorim. Also in Daman & Diu.*
2. *UGP did not contest Pernem, Shiroda, Madkai and St Estevam seats in
Goa as well as Daman and Diu.*
3. *The 8 PSP Independents means those who officially did not withdraw
but were not given party forms, publicly withdrawn from the fray and
remained on the ballot paper as Independents.*

Participation in the freedom struggle was also an important criteria
laid down by all the parties while choosing their
candidates. Altogether 39 freedom fighters had entered the fray from
five different parties. From among them, 10 were elected to the first
Assembly of Goa and two among them also became ministers in the first
MGP government.

Among them, a maximum number of 18 freedom fighters were fielded by
the Congress and six equally towering personalities had entered the
fray from Frente Popular. All 24 of them had played an inspirational
role to win the ‘Battle of Independence’, but they lost the ‘Battle of
Democracy’, along with all other candidates of their parties. However,
the MGP could get six freedom fighters elected out of the nine fielded
by the party. Both the PSP MLAs were freedom fighters too. A total of
eight out of 16. Two among these, Fernandes and Karmali also became
ministers.

The UGP had also fielded four freedom fighters. Among
them, only John M D’Souza (Calangute) and Enio Pimenta
(Curtorim) could make it to the Assembly. The other two, Shivaji
Dubhashi (Bicholim) and Cristovao Furtado (Sanguem) lost the
battle to the MGP.[^22]

The entire battle was fought neither on Hindu-Christian religious
lines nor on Brahmin versus Bahujan Samaj caste lines as it appeared
to have been projected all these years. There were freedom fighters
elected from all the parties including the UGP, which was allegedly
termed as pro-Portuguese by their opponents. On the other hand, the
most prominent freedom fighters from the Congress and the Frente
Popular were defeated.

There were Christian MLAs elected from Hindu-dominated areas like Tony
Fernandes (MGP) from Sanguem and Dr Jack de Sequeira (UGP) from
Panaji. In fact the main battle in Sanguem was between two
Christians. There were Brahmins elected from constituencies that had a
negligible presence of upper castes, as in Atchut Usgaonkar’s case in
Pale. Eminent freedom fighters like Dr Ram Hegde, in a straight fight,
had lost to a common man like Pundalik Sagun Naik. He polled 74 per
cent votes.  And the startling outcome in the remote areas like Pernem
and Mandrem was that the farming community had taught a lifetime
lesson to the mighty landlords and mine owners that electoral literacy
had nothing to do with educational illiteracy.  It was truly a
revolutionary battle that was won in this so-called ‘backward’ border
taluka of North Goa.

Through this fierce battle on economic lines and Goan identity, the
new battleground emerged. The first Goa Assembly had some *Bhatkars* and
some Kull and Mundkars. There were Brahmins and upper caste Chardos
with *Bhatkar* mentality as well as some having a progressive outlook
for land reforms.

There were also professionals like lawyers, doctors, teachers, small
traders, and even farmers. A perfect combination of crosssections of
the society to run the first ever democratically elected Assembly of
Goa!

The core component of the first ever democratic battle of Goa was: The
Ownership of Land!
