# The 'Gifts' of Portuguese

It was not the Communidades alone that got transformed into a feudal
system, making the original cultivators its tenants. Goa was not an
exception to the rise of feudalism in the Indian subcontinent. The
entire Konkan coast, along with Goa, was ruled by several dynasties,
from the North as well as South of India. Goa was ruled by 17 various
dynasties including the King of Portugal. But the feudal system on the
ground continued to be the same, until the European colonialists
entered this coastal land.

India’s eminent historian Romila Thapar, quotes D D Kosambi to explain
his model of feudalism from above and below:[^1]

> *“...that from above was where feudatories were directly subordinate
> to the ruler without the intervention of other intermediaries; and
> feudalism from below created a hierarchy of landowning
> intermediaries between the king and the peasant.”*

[^1]: Thapar Romila: Early India From the Origin to AD 1300 P 23

According to Thapar, the existing land economy was restructured by the
ruler giving substantial grants of land to religious beneficiaries or
to officers for their services. In time, the grant was accompanied by
a transfer of fiscal and juridical rights from the ruler to the
grantees.

> *“Contractual relations in this model seem to have been limited to
> those between the king and the intermediary, referred to by
> historians as feudatory. Underlying his loyalty to the king, the
> feudatory was expected to maintain armed levies, which he was duty
> bound to furnish for the king’s service... The use of a title and
> symbols of status were allowed, such as a throne, a flywhisk, a
> palanquin, the riding of an elephant in state processions and being
> heralded by the sound of the five special musical instruments. The
> surplus wealth of the feudatories went into conspicuous consumption
> imitating the royal court, particularly in palatial homes, and in
> richly endowed temples.  Some of the more powerful intermediaries
> were permitted to grant land in their turn, without necessarily
> obtaining permission from the king... Such feudatories often had
> their own sub-feudatories, thus building up a hierarchy... The
> hierarchy was reflected in the titles taken by the feudatories,
> where the more exalted called themselves mahasamanta,
> mahamandaleshvara, and the lesser ones were the raja, samanta,
> ranaka, thakkura and so on… the kings took exalted titles such as
> maharajadhiraja, parameshvara, parambhattaraka and even
> bharatehsvara.”*[^2]

## Land Gifts By Dynasties

How did feudalism evolve in Goa? Who ruled Goa? The real kings, or the
feudatories, who also called themselves Rajas? Recorded history claims
that the Bhojas were the first dynastic rulers in Goa, in the third or
fourth century. But some historians feel that Goa could also have been
part of the Maurya empire (322 to 185 BCE), which was ruling over
almost the whole of the Indian subcontinent. The Bhojas were
feudatories of Samrat (Emperor) Ashoka of the Mauryan empire in the
Konkan.[^3] So there are varied interpretations, and some dynasty periods
also overlapped each other because in most of the cases, the
feudatories of the kings often set up their own kingdoms later on. The
various dynasties include the Mauryas, Satavahana, Kshatrapa, Bhoja,
Indo-Parthian, Abhira, Chalukya, Rashtrakuta, Shilahara, Konkan
Maurya, Kadamba, Devgiri Yadava, Vijaynagari, Bahamani Sultanate,
Adilshahi dynasties, followed by the Portuguese colonial rulers.

[^3]: Pereria Gerlad A: An Outline of Pre-Portuguese History of Goa

But the more interesting aspect of these dynasties is that
most of these kings were actually the feudatories of other kings,
sometimes more than one king. For example, the Satavahanas
were the administrative officers of the Mauryas, the Bhojas
were administrative officers of the Satavahanas as well as the
Chalukyas, while the Chalukyas were at one time subordinate
to the Kadamba kings. The Shilaharas were the ‘samanta’ of
the Rashtrakutas as well as the Chalukya dynasties.[^4] Some of
them broke away from the ruler while others set up their own
kingdoms after the dynasties of their overlords collapsed.

Two history professors of Goa University − N Shyam Bhat
and Nagendra Rao − have studied the history of Goa afresh
(2013), with special reference to its feudal features and recorded
their findings:[^5]

The historical research through copper plates, inscriptions, etc. has
established the fact that land grants were made to the Brahmins of
Goa, who in turn legitimised the position of the kings. This they did
as scholars or officials assisting the kings in their courts and by
recording the munificent deeds of the kings. The vassal was apparently
given powers to give land grants without even taking the permission of
his overlord. In most of the cases, the cultivable land was grabbed
from the cultivators (even *Gaunkari* land) and granted to the Brahmins.
The Brahmins then got it cultivated from the peasants − either the
tenants or the landless agricultural labour. Thus, the state, the
landlord and the peasant figured as the major groups in the agrarian
setup.

Historians have found copper plates of the Bhojas granting even the
rich cultivable khazan lands belonging to the *Gaunkari* to Brahmins,
due to which the Saraswat Brahmins became a dominant and influential
power in the community institutions.  Besides khazan lands, they were
also granted a house site, garden (*kullagar*) and water tanks (*tallim*)
for irrigation. This trend was followed by all the subsequent
dynasties all across Goa.

In fact, the Shilaharas even granted entire villages to the Brahmins,
not just pieces of land. And the Brahmins allotted land to the people
involved in service to the temple, including the oilman, gardener
supplying flowers, dhobi, temple servants etc. The *Gaunkars* had no
option but to accept the entry of new migrant cultivators in the
sphere of agriculture. But those new entrants were not given the right
to manage Ganvponn and were not allowed the status of mahajan of
temples.

The Kadamba regime went one step ahead and granted villages to a group
of 30-40 Brahmins to set up centres of learning like Pathashala and
even Vedshala. This marked a drastic change in the functioning of
village communities and Saraswat Brahmins, as kulkarnis (accountants
and secretaries who kept records), establishing their rule in the
village communities. Historians have found documentary evidence of
granting land and also the whole village to individuals or
groups. These villages, for example, were Parcem and Korgao in Pernem
taluka, Cudne in Bicholim, Colvale and Nerul in Bardez, Shiroda,
Bandora, Savoi-Verem and Madkai in Ponda, Cumbarjua, Ela, Goa Velha
and Moula in Tiswadi, Chandor, Curtorim, Raia and Madgao in Salcete,
as well as Cortalim in Mormugao.[^6]

This is precisely the reason, in Goa, we find today big landlords
owning the villages, especially Deshprabhu and Desai in Pernem, Ranes
in Sattari, Dempo in Tiswadi etc, who were the tax collectors, as well
as a vassal (Mandalika) like Sondekar owning huge tracts of land in
Tiswadi, Ponda, Canacona, and Dharbandora talukas. We also find
Brahmin *Bhatkars* (landlords) ruling Communidades while some Kshatriya
sardars are also landlords and *Gaunkars*, who also rule through the
temple committees. It simply did not matter to them which dynasty
ruled, since they were the actual rulers of all these dynasties and
feudatories for over 2000 years.

D D Kosambi, a veteran historian of Goan origin, has a different story
to tell. According to him, the Adilshahis had Desais appointed from
the Kshatriya clan to collect revenue and they were hated for their
autocratic behaviour. They forced their former equals to work as
menials in the household, and treated the community land as feudal, if
not private property. This hatred led to the local population
welcoming the Portuguese, who guaranteed them to preserve all their
ancient local institutions. The Portuguese abolished the Desai system
in the Old Conquests.[^7]

However, the Portuguese later adopted the policy of religious
conversions and many Brahmins as well as Kshatriya landlords got
converted. These high profile local converts were not treated on par
with the Portuguese officials, especially the white Portuguese
priests. Even the Portuguese high court had reviewed the decree,
according to which the Goan Christians had to be accorded the same
privileges as the Portuguese whites. By 1705, Goa had almost 2500
natives as the priests and the majority among them were Brahmins. As a
result, Goan history witnessed three revolts − Matheus de Crasto in
the 17th century, the Pinto conspiracy in the 18th century, and the
unrest stirred up by Padre Alvares in the 19th century. All these
revolts were led by Christian Brahmins. None of them included the
Christian Chardos, who belong to the warrior class. In fact, the
Chardos allied themselves with the Portuguese administration to gain
social ascendancy over their traditional caste rivals − the
Brahmins.[^8]

To understand Goa’s election politics of today, we need to understand
the socio-cultural structure of Goa. We also need to see what Goa has
historically meant to the world and how this is significant to Goa’s
politics. There are broadly two Goas in one Goa. The old Goa and the
new Goa. They walk differently, talk differently, think differently
and, politically, they also react differently. And this is all beyond
caste, creed, or religion.  Unless this metamorphosis of Goa is
perceived, we simply cannot proceed.

It’s a myth that the Portuguese ruled the entire state of Goa for four
and a half centuries. The Portuguese arrived in Goa in 1510 and kept
on conquering different parts of Goa for nearly three centuries,
till 1788. They first conquered only the Island of Goa (Tiswadi),
consisting of the City of Goa (Old Goa) and three islands of Divar,
Chorao, and St Estevao. After a series of bloody battles with the
Adilshahi and Vijaynagari empires for 38 long years, the Portuguese
finally succeeded in getting a permanent hold over Bardez and Salcete
by 1548. Mormugao at that time was part of Salcete. These were called
the Velhas Conquistas (Old Conquests). The rest of the eight talukas,
which were called Nova Conquistas (New Conquests) came under the
Portuguese empire in the second half of the 18th century: Ponda,
Sanguem and Quepem in 1763, Canacona in 1764, Bicholim and Sattari in
1781 and Pernem in 1788. Dharbandora taluka is now being carved out
from Sanguem.[^9]

The Old Conquests covered an area of only 755 square kilometres while
the New Conquests were a huge part of Goa, around 2947 square
kilometres. It means around 80 per cent of today’s Goa was ruled by
the Portuguese for less than two centuries.[^10]

    1900-1961
[^10]: Mendonca Delio de: Conversions and Citizenry, Goa under the
    Portugal 1510-1610

Despite this, Goa’s politics till date has been dominated by the Old
Conquests. Goans faced major turbulence in this territory as the
Portuguese went on a rampage of demolishing all the Hindu temples and
Muslim mosques, converting Hindus and Muslims to Christianity, and
inflicting the most brutal and inhuman Inquisition upon the newly
converted Christians. This resulted in a mass exodus of the people and
also in people losing or gaining properties.

*“The religion of the king should be the religion of the subjects,”*
was the prevailing view in 16th century Europe. So it was naturally
the official policy of the King of Portugal to onvert non-Christians
within the territories under his control.[^11]

Following this policy, the Portuguese came to India with ‘a sword in
one hand and a cross in the other’. But did they use the cross so
brutally everywhere? The conversion spree continued for almost 100
years, from 1510 to 1610. The first phase of conversion of 30 years,
till 1540, was mild, not accompanied by persecution. The Franciscans
converted people by persuasion and by offering
incentives. Albuquerque’s policy of mixed marriages of his army men
with Hindu and Muslim women also led to some conversions.[^12]

[^11]: Gazetteer of Goa, Daman and Diu, Part I Goa P 153
[^12]: Ibid 154

The King of Portugal had turned down the suggestion to begin
conversions, made by Duarte Nunes, Bishop of Funchal, during his visit
to Goa in 1522. He took a decision to destroy temples and mosques in
1540, three decades after conquering the Island of Goa. Afonso de
Albuquerque had to fight two battles to conquer Goa within a year as
Adilshah had recaptured it after the first conquest. In retaliation,
Albuquerque demolished several Muslim mosques and massacred over 6000
Moor Muslims. But he did not touch the Muslim merchants.  He did not
demolish Hindu temples, except for one ancient temple called a Pagoda
in Divar. During this phase, he had assured all kinds of protection to
the Hindus. Their relations were cordial.[^13]

> *“The Hindus who had left the island of Goa earlier (during
> Adilshahi rule), due to political discontentment, on knowing
> that Albuquerque demanded only half of the rent that they
> used to pay to the Muslims, and that he would also let their
> own chiefs govern their lands, returned to Goa. The initial liberal
> Portuguese fiscal system changed the social and economic life
> in Goa.”*[^14]

Following Goa, the Portuguese had also conquered two ports near
Gujarat from the Shah − Diu in 1546 and Daman in 1559, after several
battles and treaties. Daman was conquered by the Viceroy Constantino
de Braganza. Historians say that 20,000 Hindus were converted in the
City of Goa during his three-year rule, much more than the conversions
that took place in 48 years since 1510.[^15] But neither he nor his
successors, till the conversion spree stopped in 1610, touched a
single Hindu in Daman or Diu. In fact the Portuguese had signed a
treaty with the Shah in 1537, not to follow a conversion policy. They
adhered to it till Goa was liberated.[^16] In 1961, when India
liberated Goa, Daman and Diu, the Hindus in Daman comprised 80 per
cent (17,874) of its total population while Muslims (2082) and
Christians (2289) were 10 per cent each. In Diu, Hindus were 91 per
cent (12,976), Muslims were second with seven per cent (1008) while
Christians were barely two per cent (296).[^17]

Then why did the Portuguese change their policy in Goa and bring about
the barbaric events of aggressive conversion?  Undoubtedly it was an
act of religious fanaticism on the part of the European colonialists
in the name of God. But there was also trade politics involved in
it. The Portuguese were the first Europeans who had arrived in India
and they wanted to capture the booming trade from the Muslims and
Arabs. They did not want to lose their hold over the City of Goa.

[^17]: Gazetteer of Goa, Daman and Diu & Census of India 1961

During the Adilshahi regime, the island had developed as one of the
principal emporiums of trade on the western coast of India, including
the horse trade from Arabia and Persian Gulfs. The beautiful and
famous port of Goa also attracted ships carrying merchandise from
Mecca, Aden, and Hormuz. It was a natural entrepot of the commerce of
Asia. After establishing its hold over the spice trade in the South,
Albuquerque got this opportunity of attacking Goa at the request of
the Hindu Brahmins of the island through Timoja alias Thimayya, who
had been exiled by the Adil Shah and was a captain in the Vijaynagari
army.

Albuquerque did not have a mandate from the King of
Portugal to capture Goa, nor did the captains of the Portuguese
fleet support him. Even after conquering Goa, the King had
told him to withdraw and discuss the matter in the council
of the fidalgos. But he managed to convince the council and
retained Goa. Albuquerque returned to Portugal by 1515, but
the Portuguese had still not decided about Goa till 1540.

> *“The work of conversion was taken up on a war footing
> when the Portuguese decided to remain in Goa and make it
> their empire’s capital. Outposts in areas bordering the Hindu
> and Muslim territories needed personnel for their defence, and

> skills in warfare."*[^18]

[^18]: Mendonca Delio de: Conversions and Citizenry, Goa under the
    Portugal 1510-1610 P 255

Perhaps this is the reason the Portuguese changed their strategy in
Goa and went on a rampage of demolishing all the Hindu and Muslims
shrines, converting the citizenry to Christianity and constituting the
Inquisition to remould them even culturally. In Dr T B Cunha’s words,
to denationalise them and make them devoted to the Portuguese
empire. That is the reason why the conversions stopped by the
beginning of the 17th century. But the horrific killings and burnings
of the ‘bad Christians’ in *Voddlem Ghor* (House of Inquisition)
continued for 245 years till it was temporarily suspended in 1774 by a
liberal minister Marquis de Pombal. All the prisoners were
released. (It was revived within four years after Pombal was driven
out of power, but was finally abolished in 1812).  Even as they
committed these atrocities, trade politics once again favoured the
Portuguese. At that time, the most powerful kingdom in South India was
the empire of Vijayanagar.

The European colonists called it the ‘Kingdom of Narsinga.’ Vir
Narsimha was also the sole powerful Hindu king. He decided not
to antagonize the Europeans, anticipating their utility as allies
against the common Muslim foes, the Adil Shahs. Much before
Goa was conquered, in October 1505, Narsimha had deputed
Thimayya along with the Gersoppa chief, Malhar Rao (called
Merlao in Portuguese records), to open negotiations with the
Portuguese Viceroy Francisco de Almeida. Later, Thimayya met
his successor Albuquerque, urging him to conquer Goa. This
means that conquering Goa was not an initiative of the Hindu
merchants of Goa who were harassed by the Adilshah regime
but a well-planned joint siege by the Vijaynagar empire and
the Portuguese colonialists. This is the reason the all-powerful
Hindu king refused to intervene when temples were destroyed
and Hindus were converted.

> *“The Hindu leaders regularly complained to the Vijayanagar rulers
> including Rama Raya, of the Portuguese highhandedness.  But the
> kings were reluctant to anger the Portuguese on whom they were
> dependent for the critical supply of horses.”*[^19]

Trade politics overrode the duty of a king to protect his
religion!

## The Landless Landlords

The City of Goa had acquired a status comparable to the City of Lisbon
in the initial period, mainly because it had become the commercial hub
of the entire Asian continent. It had become a powerful political,
administrative, and religious centre. The first four decades were the
most prosperous in the Estado do India. No local coins are believed to
have been minted during this period, only foreign currency was
circulated in Goa. Commerce was in the hands of the Muslims and
Hindus.  The Brahmins were indispensable as interpreters, clerks, and
tax collectors. To compete commercially with the Muslims, the
Portuguese had allied with the Brahmins. The Brahmins had thus become
the most dominant group in the economies of Tiswadi, Bardez, and
Salcete.[^20]

Study in Military History

    Portugal 1510-1610 P 78

However, the situation changed drastically in the next decade. The
Portuguese weakened their control over the spice trade. The Vijaynagar
empire, which had been trading with the Portuguese, collapsed
by 1564. The port that once attracted hundreds of ships was almost
empty by 1568. The Portuguese then turned their eye towards
agricultural lands to accrue more revenue and also started working on
consolidating their position through other varied means. It is around
this time that largescale conversions began. This resulted in the
twenty-century long feudal system of land holdings undergoing a
phenomenal transformation. It was much more than just
institutionalising the *Gaunkari* of community ownership through
Communidades and converting cultivator owners of the land into
tenants.

It is a well-known historical fact that the Portuguese demolished
hundreds of Hindu temples, beginning with 157 temples and shrines in
34 villages all across the Island of Goa (Tiswadi) in 1541. As the
Portuguese authorities confiscated the temple properties, the
missionaries started converting Hindus and Muslims to
Christianity. When Francis Xavier arrived in Goa in 1542, almost
10,000 Hindus and Muslims had been converted in Tiswadi.[^21] However,
though the Portuguese had Bardez and Salcete in a firm grip by 1548,
they crossed the Zuari and Mandovi rivers and started ‘mission
demolition’ in Salcete and Bardez only in 1560. Over 300 temples and
shrines in the 66 villages of Salcete and 117 from 40 villages of
Bardez were razed to the ground.[^22]

Religious conversions were taken up by the missionaries of the Church
of different orders. The Franciscans were the first to arrive in 1517
and they converted 800 Hindus and Muslims in the Island of Goa within
a year.[^23] Then they moved to Bardez.  The Jesuits, who came in
1542, were the most influential order that came to Goa. They gave a
strong impetus to missionary activity. Tiswadi and Salcete were
allotted to them. Then came the Dominicans in 1548 to join hands with
the Jesuits in Tiswadi,[^24] followed by the Augustinians.

Delio de Mendonça, former director of Goa’s Xavier Historical Research
Centre, in his book “Conversions and Citizenry”, categorises
conversions in three phases:

> *“During the first phase (1510-1540), the kings of Portugal showed a
> great interest in conversions, but very few conversions had been
> made... The second period (1540-1580)... saw the greatest number of
> converts and the most overt proselytising conduct. The third phase
> (1580-1610) witnessed the decline of the ‘Golden Goa’, but in spite
> of this fact conversions went on increasing in the districts of
> Bardez and Salcete.”*[^25]

But were the conversions forceful? Were there direct threats to either
convert or leave Goa? Why did thousands of Hindus convert? Out of
conviction and faith in Jesus Christ? Or to save their land and
properties? Were there other temptations?  There are varied answers to
this.

But this does not mean that all Hindus were falling prey to these
tactics and there were no Hindus left in the Old Conquests after this
crusade of Christianity. Many Hindus, especially the wealthy and
influential Brahmins and Kshatriyas refused to get converted. While
the Portuguese had constituted the Inquisition to ‘deal’ with the
neo-convert Christians, they simultaneously began to promulgate
anti-Hindu laws, making life difficult for the Hindus. This went on
for 16 long years, from 1559 to 1575.

The most aggressive among the viceroys was Dom Constantino de Braganza
(1558-1561) who destroyed the remaining temples and idols and expelled
the Brahmins by giving them a one-month deadline to sell their
immovable properties.  The powerful Brahmins tried to dissuade
Braganza but failed.  Then they closed their shops, persuaded the
cultivators to destroy the dikes in the paddy fields to allow
saltwater to fill them and left Goa. The cultivators who were left
behind refused to work and religious intolerance grew still
worse. Those who were left behind agreed to conversion in order to
save their properties. The trend that started in Carambolim in Tiswadi
spread to Bardez and Salcete.

As this aggressive drive depopulated Goa, Francisco Coutinho
(1561-1564), the next viceroy, passed a decree restoring confiscated
properties and the Brahmins returned. But the Brahmins continued
opposing conversions and persuaded neo-converts to abandon their
faith. No solemn baptism could take place for two years. In 1563,
Coutinho then ordered the expulsion of the Brahmins who indulged in
anti-Christian (reconversion) activities. However, those who did not
oppose conversions were spared, including tillers, doctors,
carpenters, ironsmiths, shopkeepers, and tax collectors. The Brahmins
had no other alternative but to sell their property and abandon Goa.

During the tenure of the next viceroy Antão de Noronha (1564-1568),
Goa witnessed the conversion of several Brahmin chiefs. However, after
an attack by some Hindus on the neoconverts, Noronha demolished the
200 remaining temples in Salcete in 1567. Besides expelling these
Hindus, government posts were kept exclusively for the
Christians. Hindu Gaunkars were excluded from Communidades when
Christian Gaunkars could form the quorum.

When Luis de Ataide (1568-1574) came in as the viceroy, he had to face
a siege by Adilshah for almost 10 months.  Conversions became
extremely difficult and poverty increased with the loss of many
Portuguese ships. However, he continued restraining Hindus from
rebuilding the temples and prohibited Hindu teachers and doctors from
teaching. The Second Provincial Council in 1575 replaced Hindus with
Christians collecting rents of the crown. Those ‘harmful’ Hindus who
were still at liberty in Goa had their lands confiscated.[^27]

Not that the attempts of conversions were countered with re-conversion
to the Hindu faith. The Brahmins had devised various simple methods of
reconversion such as bathing in the sea on the birthday of Lord
Krishna (Gokulashtami) or being sprinkled with water from the sacred
river Ganga. The Portuguese also exploited the Inquisition, which was
technically meant for neo-convert Christians, to act against the
Hindus who prevented others from converting. Hindus were effectively
denied access to their laws. Eventually the people preferred to keep
their lands rather than their religious convictions.[^28]

Rowena Robinson, a professor at IIT Bombay, has written
a book “Conversion, Continuity and Change: Lived Christianity
in Southern Goa”. She has analysed afresh the conversions from
a socio-historical point of view:

In the series of events that happened during the whole demolition and
conversion spree, the land and properties changed hands several
times. Many devoted Hindu landlords and others became landless and
left Goa forever. A new group of landowners emerged along with the
feudal lords of yesterday who preferred conversion to their old
faith. This dominant group of landlords, traders, educators, tax
collectors, and even priests formed a new kind of feudal system in the
Old Conquests, which was quite different from the feudal system
prevalent in the New Conquests.

This dominant group is still hounding the politics of Goa!

## Mokaso, Alvara, and Aforamento

The story of land holdings in the New Conquests is very different
since 80 per cent of Goa remained under the Adilshahi rule even while
the Portuguese were ruling the Old Conquests.  The Adilshahi regime
came to an end in 1686 with its absorption in the Mughal
empire. Meanwhile, there were a series of battles between the
Portuguese, Marathas, and the Adilshah to capture several parts of
Goa. But in reality, they were managed and ruled by the same
feudatories like Sawants of Kudal, Desais of Pernem and Bicholim, and
Ranes of Sattari. They were appointed as Desai, a post of a ‘royal
servant’ prevalent in the Adilshahi administration, to collect tax of
the land belonging to the cultivators. The other parts of the New
Conquests like Ponda, Quepem, Sanguem, Canacona, and Dharbandora were
under the regime of the vassal Sondekar.

Subsequently, these feudatories and vassals laid claims to be the
landowners of the former community land. None of them actually
cultivated the land. But today even after the Land to the Tiller Act
has been enacted by the Goa government, they continue to own the
land. The same land and these landowners are playing a major role in
Goan politics today. We have seen earlier in the chapter regarding
Communidades that Goa actually had 426 registered Communidades. Out of
these, only 225 exist today. Among the non-existent 201 Communidades,
180 were in the New Conquests. It is still a ‘political mystery’ as to
who took over these huge tracts of cultivable land during the
Portuguese regime.

### AFORAMENTO

Aforamento is a provision in the Communidade system of leasing out
limited areas of land for agriculture or housing. The special chapter
VI on Aforamento in the Code of Communidade states: The comunidades
may grant Aforamento – emphyteusis in respect its uncultivated and
undeveloped lands and even the ones cultivated of vegetables, when
required for the cultivation of rice, fruit-bearing trees or for the
construction of houses.[^29]

[^29]: Code of Communidade

This has turned out to be a big scam of selling Aforamento land for
housing projects, with former chief minister Digambar Kamat making
this charge and the current Chief Minister Dr Pramod Sawant totally
agreeing with him, in an Assembly debate held on 7 August 2019.

Kamat observed that under this system, no land more than 400 square
metres can be granted for residential purposes while documentary
evidence has shown that land from 10,000 square metres to 30,000
square metres has been granted on long term lease for housing
complexes. Also, lakhs of square metres of land have been shown for
institutional purposes.

Chief Minister Dr Pramod Sawant was immediately on his feet, assuring
an inquiry into these cases while he justified Aforamento land being
given for schools or crematoriums, etc.  But he asserted that it
cannot be sold to the builders, in violation of the Code of
Communidades.

The most pertinent was a reply by Revenue Minister Jennifer
Monserratte: “No audit of Aforamento properties has been
conducted till date.” She could not provide information to the
House as to how much Communidade land has been granted
as Aforamento. But she assured that a thorough inquiry would
be conducted into the illegalities in the name of Aforamento as
well as Alvara land.[^30]

[^30]: Assembly debate on 7 Aaugust 2019

### ALVARA

In order to increase the agricultural production and land revenue, the
Portuguese started the Alvara system in 1917 under decree number 3602
of allotting government-owned land mainly for agricultural purposes on
lease to the local cultivators. After liberation, the same decree was
absorbed into the Land Revenue Code, 1968, which came into force on 1
March 1971.

Under this, the land grants were classified into three categories: The
first two are the ones where occupants are allowed to hold the land in
perpetuity, which means forever, but on payment of regular ‘foro’ to
the government. However, under Class I, the cultivator has no
restriction on transferring the land. Under Class II, ownership in
perpetuity is permitted but there are restrictions on transfer of
land. The third category is the Government lessees, who are granted
land for a fixed period of time. All these leases get cancelled if the
land is kept fallow without cultivation or if the annual ‘foro’ is not
paid. Eventually, in 2007, it was amended by making all grants deemed
to be Class II since 1971. It means no occupant could transfer or sell
the land.

The Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG), in its 2015 report
which was repeated once again in 2016, has pointed out several
discrepancies in Alvara land. In fact it is a big real estate
scam. The findings are really shocking and stunning.

First of all, the CAG could not get proper Alvara land records from
the local taluka Mamlatdars. They are the custodians of the Alvara
property and need to maintain the Records of Rights (ROR). Bicholim
Mamlatdar reported 63 Alvara lands when actually there are
only 55. Other lands have been reverted. The Mamlatdar of Canacona
reported only 31 cases when actually there are 169 Alvara land
holders.

Six Mamlatdars of Pernem, Sattari, Salcete, Tiswadi, Sanguem, and
Dharbandora have not maintained records of Alvara lands, when these
six talukas have 98 per cent of total Alvara lands and 91 per cent of
Alvara ‘cultivators’: altogether 7174 occupants out of total 7871
state-wise and 16,336 hectares of Alvara land out of total 16,617
hectares. It means no records are maintained of 16.33 crore square
metres of Alvara land!

As though this was not enough, four Mamlatdars of Ponda, Mormugao,
Bardez, and Quepem stated that they do not have any Alvara lands. In
reality, there are 473 occupants and 17.80 lakh square metres of
Alvara land in these talukas.

The CAG found this ‘disappeared’ land with the Directorate
of Settlement and Land Record.

**Alvara Land Holdings In Goa**

| TALUKA    | LEASES   | AREA IN HECTARES |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Sattari   | 3080     | 7107.141         |
| Sanguem   | 1383     | 6149.690         |

| Mormugao  | 259      | 50.826           |
| Bardez    | 93       | 25.258           |

| **Total** | **7871** | **16616.837**    |

*Source: CAG Report 2015*

These are the stunning findings of the CAG, when the rule
is that Alvara land cannot be diverted for any other purpose
than agriculture:

- In 104 cases involving a total area of 95.30 lakh square metres of
  Alvara land, the leaseholder is shown as the occupant, instead of
  the government.
- In 11 cases involving 8.80 lakh square metres of land, lands were
  sold without the permission of the government. Among these 11, in
  four cases, Mamlatdar incorrectly mutated the records in favour of
  the buyers of the land. In six cases, the Alvara land was
  partitioned and sold as plots. And in one case, the leaseholder,
  shown in the column of ‘other rights’ sold the land to a private
  party and sale deed was registered when the ‘occupant’ was
  Government of Goa.
- In five cases, between 1973 to 1981, around 4.36 lakh square metres
  of land was reverted back to the government. In spite of this, it
  was sold to a third party between 1992 to 2011.
- No land can be re-classified as Class I occupancy without government
  permission. Despite this, in four cases in Pernem and Tiswadi
  talukas, six lands were re-classified as Class I, so that they could
  sell the land without government permission.
- In another seven cases involving Alvara lands of 1.94 lakh square
  metres in Mandrem village and in Panaji city (both hot tourist
  spots), the North Goa Collector regularised it by collecting a
  meagre value compared to the prevailing official market price. In
  Mandrem, the rate applied was Rs 15 per square metre when the market
  price was Rs 400 per square metre. And in Panaji, at the rate of
  only 795 per square metre when the market price was Rs 25,000 per
  square metre. Within four months, these lands were re-classified as
  Class I and the leaseholders sold it without government permission
  for a total value of Rs 13.53 crore!

The CAG scrutinised just a few cases as a sample in the
audit. It means these findings are just the tip of the iceberg!

Kishor Naik Gaonkar, a senior journalist and original resident of Tuem
village of Pernem taluka, has been voicing out the Alvara land scams
for over a decade. He gives a slightly different version than the CAG
report. According to him, the Portuguese decree has a clear mention of
holding the Alvara lease in perpetuity if the cultivator cultivates
the land consistently for 10 years by paying Foro etc. But during the
land survey held in the ‘70s, the surveyors did not enter names of
hundreds of cultivators and also registered their ‘own persons’ as the
cultivators. The Goa government also seized the land from the rightful
cultivators by changing the law and compelled them to purchase the
land at Rs five per square metres, which they could not
afford. Hundreds of applications seeking ownership have not been
disposed of over 15 years now. Also land sharks have started
purchasing the land by ‘helping’ the poor cultivators to own the
land.[^31]

While these rampant irregularities were going on, the real cultivators
from Sattari rose up in 2020 against the setting up of a prestigious
educational project of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in the
government land at Shell-Melauli village. They claimed to be the
traditional cultivators of this government land from ancient times
when the democratic government termed them as ‘encroachers’. The
struggle spread out to the whole of Sattari taluka with all the
villagers marching in Valpoi town even after the IIT project was
scrapped. These real cultivators, who are living on agriculture in the
remote talukas, have been fighting for the ownership of their land of
Communidade’s Aforamento, Alvara and the Cumeri land of shifting
cultivation in the forests. Even their village settlements, called
Gauthan, have been registered in land records as encroachments. This
issue is widely prevalent in the New Conquests.

### MOKASSO

Besides this, the Sattari taluka in particular, is also fighting for
the ownership of Mokasso land, which is held by Ranes and Desai, who
were the royal servants working under different dynasties and even
during the Portuguese regime as mere tax collectors of the land.

Mokasso is a system of landholding prevalent in the Sattari taluka and
two villages of Bicholim: Maulinguem and Karapaur.  Those who are
holding Mokashe are called Mokasdars, or *Khashe*. There are altogether
12 Mokashe in Sattari and parts of Bicholim and their owners are
either Ranes or Desais. They not only own the cultivable land but the
whole village, including the housing land. These Mokashe were given to
them during the Adilshahi Sultanate. Today, they claim to be the
owners of Mokashe.[^32]

[^32]: राणे रणजीतसिंग जयसिंगराव; सत्तरीतील जमीन मालकीची व्यथा व उपाय

One of the mighty *Khashe* of Sattari is Pratapsingh Raoji Rane
Sardessai, who has had a record run in Indian politics by getting
elected consistently for 50 years, from 1972 to 2022.  He was the
revenue and law minister in the Bandodkar and Kakodkar ministries of
the MGP and then the Chief Minister of the Congress governments for 17
years, out of which he ruled for 10 years continuously from 1980
to 1990. He was also the Speaker of the Goa Assembly and Leader of the
Opposition, perhaps the only politician of Goa who has enjoyed all the
highest positions in the government and the elected Assembly.

No person other than the *Khashe* has ever been elected the MLA of the
constituencies in Sattari taluka. The only exception was Gopal Apa
Kamat, an outsider elected in 1967 on an MGP ticket, by defeating
independent candidate Baburao Desai, another *Khashe*. However, after
Pratapsingh Rane entered the election arena in 1972, he ruled Sattari
till the taluka was divided into two constituencies, Poriem and
Valpoi, after Statehood from the 1989 Assembly election. Pratapsingh
Rane is still the Poriem MLA. In Valpoi, Rane-supported candidates
were defeated only twice by BJP’s Narhari Haldankar, in 1994 and
in 2002. Otherwise, Valpoi MLA has always been represented by the MLAs
blessed by Rane. Ashok Prabhu, not a *Khashe* in 1989; another *Khashe*,
Venkatesh alias Bandu Desai in 1999; and then Vishwajit Pratapsingh
Rane, the Junior *Khashe* known popularly as Baba, since 2007. It did
not matter to Baba’s voters whether he contested as an independent,
Congress, BJP, or quit any party any time to face bye-elections on
another party’s ticket.

Now, since the Senior Rane has grown old, Baba is planning to field
his wife Divya from Poriem. Most of the time, the main opponents to
them in all the elections were also the *Khashe*.  Who are these *Khashe*
or Mokasdar, holding the whole villages as Mokasso, the system which
is not found anywhere else in Goa?

The concept of Mokasdar is not found anywhere in the Goan agrarian
system. Its roots are found in western Maharashtra and parts of
Konkan. When the Yadava dynasty was overthrown by the Delhi Sultanate
in the 14th century, people from capital Devagiri (present day
Daulatabad in today’s Aurangabad district) started moving out. The
servant class moved into western Maharashtra and started settling down
in the region by cooperating with the local Naga tribes. The land in
their localities was distributed among the people. They were called
Thalkari. One among them was chosen as Mokasdar or Patil, under whose
leadership the community system was functioning. He was allotted a
larger part of the land and its output was also utilized for the
village welfare.[^33]

Through this developed the role of the Mokasdar, which was similar to
the Desais or Deshmukhs found in the Adilshahi administration. But
Mokasdari is not found in the Adilshahi administration.[^34]
Historical references are found that Maloji Bhosle, the
great-great-grandfather of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was a Mokasdar
and a Sardar with an army of 30,000.[^35] Shivaji’s administrative
system has the concept of Mokasdar, who was the Sardar appointed to
collect taxes from the people.[^36] Even today, thousands of families are
found in Maharashtra with surnames Mokasdar.

Ranjeetsingh Jaisinghrao Rane, whose father was the first MLA of
Sattari, told me that Rane Sardesai were not the feudatories directly
under Adilshah but under the Khem Sawant Desai of Sindhudurg-Kudal. He
introduced their ancestor Satroji Rane to the Adilshah as his ‘*khaas
aadmi*’, through which the word *Khashe* evolved. Satroji, the son of
Sajjan Singh from Rajasthan, fought with his Sardar family for not
giving him the hereditary rights and travelled down to Shrirangpur
near Kolhapur. From there he came down to Sattari, after which Khem
Sawant requested him to look after tax collection work of 70 villages
of Sattari and 60 villages of Konkan. Eventually, it remained limited
only to 70 villages of Sattari. Perhaps because Khem Sawant was
already the Desai of the Adilshahi regime, he called Ranes as Mokasdar
and the villages as Mokashe.


Desai or Sardesai or Deshmukh is not a surname but post of hereditary
officer in the administrative set up of Adilshahi Sultanate, which was
set up in 1489 and was annexed to the mighty Mughal Empire
in 1686. Almost two centuries. The Desai’s duties were 1) to maintain
his loyalty to the Sultan, 2) to perform the official tasks, 3) to pay
the fixed annual tribute to the royal treasury, 4) to designate a
person who would stand as guarantor for the Desai’s good conduct and
loyalty, and 5) to pay the ‘inam-patti’ either to the royal treasury
through the Havaldar of the place or to the fief-holder in case the
Pargana was assigned in fief.

The Desai or Deshmukh were the chief of a Pargana containing roughly
10 to 200 villages. The Hereditary Offices were generally monopolised
by a few high castes of Hindus such as Brahmans, Marathas, Prabhus and
Lingayats. If the Desai was guilty of disobedience, disturbance or
rebellion, the Sultan would either send an army from the central
government or mobilise the troops maintained under the Havaldar and
Desais of other Parganas to crush the revolt and to arrest the Desai
and send him to the capital. (According to Ranjeetsingh Rane, one such
Mokaso of Kumarkhan was confiscated by the Portuguese. It belonged to
Dipaji Rane)

By dismantling the *Gaunkari* system prevalent earlier, the 12 Mokashe
(or vatan) were given to Ranes by Khem Sawant Desai during the
Adilshahi regime. These are, now in Sattari: 1) Keri, 2) Parye, 3)
Khadki, 4) Saleli, 5) Kumarkhann, 6) Savordem, 7) Gullem, 8) Thane, 9)
Vadaval, and 10) Brahmakarmali. The two more, which now fall in
Bicholim taluka are 11) Maulingeum and 12) Karapur.

Though Ranes are respected as *Khashe* in Sattari, mention
of their Mokashe are not found in today’s revenue records.
Babu Kavalekar, the MLA, had asked for details of Mokashe in
Sattari in 2017. The official reply said: *“There is no Mokasso
land in other parts of Goa other than Sattari. Government does
not intend to give tenancy or ownership rights to the tillers of
Mokasso land. No steps are taken in this regard.*”[^38]

[^38]: Khaunte Rohan, Revenue Minister’s reply to Chandrakant Kavalekar LAQ No 016, 3 August
2017

The revenue department of Government of Goa in the reply mentions only
one Mokasso of Querim village, which is held by Manoramabai Rauji Rane
and 21 others. Also 47 tenants and 659 houses in the Mokasso
land. This Mokasso jointly belonged to Jaisinghrao Venkatrao Rane and
Pratapsingh Rane’s father Rauji. Being the strong proponent of Land to
the Tiller, Sattari’s first MLA Jaisingrao registered all the tillers
as tenants and made the land they were cultivating in their respective
names. A similar pattern was also followed by Baburao Desai, another
*Khashe* of Thane who had contested elections in Sattari in 1963 on
Congress ticket and in 1967 as Congress-supported Independent. He lost
both the elections, but made the tenants the owners of their
cultivated land.

The information I gathered by moving in Sattari and talking to the
people however revealed that 50 out of 70 villages of Sattari come
under these Mokashe. What they provided are rough estimates and not
the exact area. It amounts to a total 6.44 crore square metres. Out of
this, roughly 2 crore square metres area is tenanted. The tenanted
land consists of the paddy fields, the cashew plantation and the
houses they live in, which is called Gauthan. Neither are they
registered as tenants nor are they the mundkars of their ancestral
houses. Till date, residents of Sattari need to take NOC from the
*Khashe* for any new construction since they own the villages. Some of
them also claim that they were paying Shidha (part of produce) to the
Mokasdar till a decade ago, for the paddy, cashew, other fruit bearing
trees and even their houses. Their future still hangs in the fire in
spite of their elected representatives holding the reins of power as
the ministers and even the chief minister.

None of the people told me that there was any attempt by any *Khashe* to
harass the cultivators, except for the incident of Saleli where people
stoned and killed Prithviraj Rane. The *Khashe* claimed to be the owners
of the rest of the land and in many cases, they have sold the land to
big companies like Godrej, Nestle, Geeta Farm, educational
institutions and even the Government of Goa. The new trend now is to
convert the land into settlement, divide it into plots and sell it to
the builders.

There are also few instances where the Government of Goa has forcibly
acquired the Mokasso, like in Saleli and Gulem. And during the
Portuguese regime, the whole Mokasso of Kumarkhan was confiscated from
the rebel leader Deepaji Rane.

The educated people of Sattari nowadays ask many questions regarding
the Mokashe. Why did the survey conducted by the Government in ‘70s
not show the tenanted land of Mokashe? Why are they not registered as
tenants? Why is the ownership of the houses still with the Mokasdar?
Why does the tenancy and mundkar acts not apply to the Mokashe land of
Sattari and Bicholim? Under what provision had the Portuguese
government confiscated the Mokasso of Deepaji Rane? Why did the same
provision not apply to the rest of the Mokashe after Goa’s liberation?
Why was the resolution proposed by Sattari’s first MLA Jaisinghrao
Venkatrao Rane to abolish all the Mokashe not implemented by the
Government of Goa?

While a major part of the land in Sattari is owned by the Mokasdar,
the remaining land is owned by the Government.  The farmers
cultivating the land of Alvara, Aforamento and Cumeri are legally
shown as the encroachers. Precisely this is the reason the whole
Sattari taluka rose up in arms when the government tried to acquire
the cultivable land of the ‘encroachers’ for the prestigious IIT
project in Shell-Melaluli.  The sword of uncertainty is kept hanging
over their heads while the ‘elected representatives’ are running the
governments, who are Mokasdar as well as ‘Government Bhatkar’.

Let me conclude this chapter with an example of the apathy
of Goan politicians towards this crucial issue of land, on which
lakhs of Goans are surviving even today. On 25 July 2014, Dr
Pramod Sawant, as the MLA of Sankhli, had raised a question in
the Assembly before then revenue minister Francisco D’Souza.
Sawant: Whether the Government is aware that the
considerable Government land is being utilised for cultivation
by the local Goans for so many years and are holding the title
of the land by some way or the other, for example lessee, alvara
holders etc?

D’Souza
: Yes, Sir.

Sawant
: If so, whether the Government is considering or in the process of
formulating any legislation to accord the rights to the cultivators of
the Government land in view of the need to bring maximum area under
cultivation?

D’Souza
: The matter is under consideration.

After Manohar Parrikar’s sad demise, Dr Sawant took over as the chief
minister from 19 March 2019. Health Minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajeet
Rane decided to take the IIT project to Shell-Melauli in his
constituency. Villagers came on the road in protest while Dr Sawant
and Rane together tried to suppress the people’s movement. Having not
succeeded in crushing the movement, on 28 September 2020, Dr Sawant
and Rane convened a meeting of villagers in Panaji. And what did Dr
Sawant tell the villagers?

> “You bring the papers as evidence of you cultivating this
> land. I will give you ownership of the land. But not here in Shell-
> Melauli; elsewhere.”

Did he conveniently forget his own demand of bringing a legislation to
give ownership of their cultivated land? Neither did he move an inch
in this direction after taking over the reins of Goa for six years
till then nor were any moves made by his government even after this
meeting. Rather than resolving the issue, both of them preferred to
push it under the carpet by scrapping the IIT project. Why?

That is the politics of land!
