### Chapter 9
# Laying the Ground for a Revolution

The process towards establishing democracy in Goa began with the
military administration being replaced by Lt Governor T Sivasankar on
8 June 1962, six months after liberation. The first step was to
appoint two Members of Parliament from South Goa and North Goa on 20
June − Dr Antonio Colaço and Dr Pundalik Gaitonde, respectively.[^1] Dr
Gaitonde belonged to the Indian National Congress, a Goa branch of
which was formally founded on 11 June. Dr Colaço, an eminent medical
practitioner and a landlord from Borda, Margao, represented the Goa
Provincial Congress.

Dr Colaço’s appointment to the Lok Sabha ignited the
first spark of public protest in Free Goa. At a public felicitation
function of both the MPs held in Mapusa on 6 July 1962,
hundreds of people gathered outside the Mapusa Municipal
building, shouting slogans against Dr Colaço and demanding
elections for MPs. Lt Governor P Sivasankar, who was the chief
guest, even had to face stone pelting at this public function.[^2]

[^2]: गोमंतक; 7 जुलै 1962

This was followed by a fast-unto-death by a young freedom fighter,
Roque Santana Fernandes, in the lobby of the Margao municipal building
from 9 July. He ended it after five days only when he got a firm
assurance to fix a meeting with PM Pandit Nehru in Bangalore to
resolve this issue. His other freedom fighter colleagues assured him
that they would go on a joint hunger strike if Nehru didn’t satisfy
him. Fernandes did not pay heed even to the written assurance by AICC
General Secretary K K Shah, during his Goa visit, that elections would
be held. The fast was also supported by several freedom fighters who
held public meetings at the venue.[^3]

The prime contention of Roque Santana Fernandes was that Dr Colaço was
an associate of the Portuguese regime and that he was one among those
who were demanding autonomy for Goa within the Portuguese empire when
Goans were giving their lives for total freedom and joining the Indian
Union.[^4] These appointments developed into the first political
controversy, which probably laid the foundation of the historic
Assembly election of 1963.

[^4]: गोमंतक; 10 जुलै 1962

The people at large were also upset over the manner in which Lt
Governor T Sivasankar had set up a 24-member Consultative
Council. Besides freedom fighters, trade union leaders, Shetkari
Sanghatana activists and leaders of the political parties, the Lt
Governor had also nominated on the Council Goa’s prominent landlords
and mine owners like Vaicuntrao Dempo, Madhavrao Talaulikar as well as
some doctors and professors who had always aligned with the
Portuguese. Due to this the Council had to take mild stands on some
land-related issues, which the people wanted Free Goa to resolve
immediately. This accommodative approach created skepticism in the
minds of the political activists.

## Making & Breaking Of The Congress

It all evolved through the National Congress Goa (NCG), which had led
Goa’s non-violent freedom struggle. Divergent views were prevailing in
the NCG even during the freedom struggle, on the issue of Goa’s
proposed merger into Maharashtra.  A strong group within the NCG had
laid down a two-point programme: 1) To free Goa from the Portuguese
and make it a part of India; and 2) To merge Goa into
Maharashtra. However, there was another group that did not want any
confrontation on the issue of shaping up Goa, especially when mining
was severely affected due to world recession, agriculture was in a bad
shape, and building Goa socio-economically seemed a Herculean task.

A group of the NCG espousing the cause of merger convened a convention
in Mapusa on 22 May 1962, chaired by the eminent freedom fighter P P
Shirodkar. The convention passed resolutions demanding Goa’s immediate
merger into Maharashtra and to promote Marathi as the official
language while calling Konkani a dialect of Marathi. This NCG group
also supported pro-merger fronts organised in several parts of Goa
like Mapusa, Kaisuv, Bicholim, Virnoda, Kavlem, Mardol, Quepem etc, in
the New Conquests as well as in Bardez. They propagated their cause by
holding meetings during the Marathi dramas performed at Zatras (Hindu
temple festivals).[^5]

Another NCG group met at the People’s High School in Panaji to decide
whether the organisation should be retained or dissolved. It was
attended by Peter Alvares, Gopal Apa Kamat, Pandurang Mulgaonkar,
Shankar Sardesai, Dr Vinayak Mayekar, Anthony D’Souza and Prafull
Priolkar among others. The meeting not only decided to retain the
organisation but also formed a committee, which met Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru in Delhi and requested him to maintain the separate
identity of Goa by promoting Konkani as well as Marathi languages.[^6]

[^6]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; मुक्तीनंतरचा गोवा पान 11

According to Purushottam Kakodkar, who later led the Congress for over
a decade, he had decided to withdraw from politics as he felt
alienated and left out by his own like-minded colleagues. The second
NCG group did not even invite him for this meeting and also did not
show him the memorandum to be submitted to the PM when his colleagues
met him in Bombay.  There was no question of the pro-merger group
contacting him since he was one of the most vociferous leaders who
opposed merger and supported Konkani as the language of Goa. However,
he changed his mind when Adv Pandurang Mulgaokar, Adv Gopal Apa Kamat
and Prof Shankar Sardesai persuaded him by meeting him twice in Margao
requesting him to take the initiative of forming a branch of Indian
National Congress in Goa. Accordingly, on 11 June 1962, an ad-hoc
committee of the INC Goa was formed with Kakodkar and Dr Pundalik
Gaitonde as its convenors.[^7]

Other members of the committee were leading freedom fighters too:
Mulgaonkar, Kamat, Sardesai, Dr J F Martins, Dr Vinayak Mayekar, Dr
Ram Hegde, Prof Laxmikant Bhembre, Anthony D’Souza, N B Rao, Alvaro
Pereira, Dr Laura D’Souza and Mitra Madhav Bir.[^8]

[^8]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; मुक्तीनंतरचा गोवा पान 17

These are the founders of the Congress party in Goa.  It was a group
of freedom fighters who had their differences of opinion on merging
Goa into Maharashtra. Kakodkar himself was a strong proponent of
maintaining a separate identity of Goa while Dr Gaitonde was
supporting the merger. The committee members also had a mix of these
opinions.

They immediately formed an Agriculture Cell headed by Madhav Bir and
Adv Mulgaonkar with the intention of taking ahead the cause of
exploited peasants who were the tenants of Bhatkars and Communidades,
as well as the issues of Kumeri cultivators etc. On the other hand,
the Azad Gomantak Dal had been converted into the Goa Democratic Party
and had organised a Shetkari Parishad in August 1962. Later on, the
Congress leaders succeeded in pursuing the militant leaders like Adv
Lawande etc to join the national party and fight unitedly for the
cause of the downtrodden masses. This move also strengthened the force
of mergerists within the Congress since most of the AGD members
favoured merger.

Differences within the Congress came to the fore when the first
organisational election was held on 20 March 1963.  Congress leader
Radha Raman from Delhi was the returning officer. The battle lines
were drawn, especially for the post of the President of Goa Pradesh
Congress Committee (GPCC). Madhav Bir was the candidate proposed by
the pro-merger leaders Adv Vishwanath Lawande and Tulshidas
Malkarnekar. Shankar Sardesai and Ligorio Cota Carvalho proposed
Kakodkar’s name.  It was 20 versus 13. Kakodkar became Goa’s first
elected president of a party, winning the election by seven votes. For
the post of Treasurer, Vasco businessman Vasant Joshi (eight votes)
lost the election to Apa Karmalkar (20 votes). Manju Gaonkar from
Canacona was elected unopposed as the vice president.

The other members elected as GPCC members were Shankar Sardesai,
Ligorio Cota Carvalho, Gopal Apa Kamat, Anthony D’Souza and
Chandrakant Kerkar. Dr Jose Francisco Martins, Sardesai and
Malkarnekar were elected as members of AICC.

But the battle was not limited to the contest between the two
groups. Laura D’Souza, an eminent freedom fighter who was heading the
National Congress Goa in 1955, sat down on a hunger strike in front of
the Congress House, alleging malpractices in the elections. She had
several complaints about the conducting of elections in Benaulim,
Vasco, Tiswadi and Pernem, and that the Congressmen who had complained
about the malpractices to the high command had been restrained from
entering the election venue. The party had to then appoint a
two-member inquiry committee consisting of R S Panchahazare and
Ramdatta Dubey. After investigating, the Committee did admit some
instances of irregularities, but termed it minor and refused to
conduct elections afresh. After that, the Kakodkar Raj began in the
Goa Congress.[^9] Laura D’Souza was then allotted a ticket to contest the
MP election from South Goa.

In a lengthy interview to *Gomantak*, Kakodkar denied all the
allegations made against him including that he had received a cheque
of Rs 25,000 from Kantilal Gosalia, a mine owner and that this money
had been used to buy votes in his favour.  He however admitted that he
had received some donations from wealthy people of Goa and that the
account books were open for scrutiny. He also claimed in this
interview that Goa had many wealthy people, but hardly any person who
could be ‘termed’ a Capitalist. What he meant by it was clear when
candidates were chosen to contest the first Assembly election.

## The Churning Of Thoughts

On the other hand, after some of the leading NCG and AGD members
joined the Congress, the socialists including Peter Alvares, Shivaji
Desai, Gajanan Raikar, etc. founded the Goa branch of the Praja
Socialist Party. The Communist leaders and trade unionists decided to
work under the guise of Frente Popular, in an attempt to try and
attract the minorities who were against the Communists due to the
influence of the Church.

Waman Radhakrishna, a veteran journalist and freedom fighter, in his
book on the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, has aptly described the
mindset of the common Goenkar at this juncture:

> *“The Bahujan Samaj was happy with Goa’s freedom but was not trying to
> understand why it had remained backward.  He was uneducated, but was
> not trying to find out the root cause behind their
> backwardness. Rather than being self-critical, he preferred to blame
> the community which had reached far ahead of him. To quite an extent,
> it was true. The high class people enjoyed all the privileges under
> the Portuguese regime…  There were three sections of Goan society that
> were exploiting the Bahujan Samaj. The Bhatkar (landlords), the Savkar
> (moneylender) and the Empregado (bureaucrat). Sometimes all these
> three sections were found together in one family. There were also some
> educated people from the Bahujan Samaj who were into money lending or
> working as Empregado. These egoistic people were considering
> themselves to be the high class. From the point of view of the Bahujan
> Samaj, they had also become ‘Bamonn’ (Brahmins)... The Bahujan Samaj
> was scared that the same people would continue exploiting them using
> their power of education and influence.”*[^10]

[^10]: राधाकृष्ण वामन; महाराष्ट्रवादी गोमंतक पक्षः स्थापना आणि वाटचाल पान 13, 15

Amidst these developments, two more socio-cultural organisations were
in search of a political solution. One was the Gomantak Maratha Samaj
(called Pragatik Maratha Samaj in those days), its members were
educated, some of them had migrated to Bombay, and some had risen up
locally in business and as professionals. They had a well-educated and
sensible leadership. They were engaged in discussing how to end the
exploitative system through democratic means in Free India.  On the
other hand was the Goa Hindu Association (GHA) of Bombay, which was
largely dominated by educated and progressive-minded Saraswat Brahmins
as well as members from the Gomantak Maratha Samaj and a few educated
members from other communities. Around the time of Goa’s liberation,
Maharashtra had also become a state through a prolonged
struggle. Yeshwantrao Chavan had adopted the Bahujan formula to rule
while enacting the Land to the Tiller Act. The agricultural sector had
started progressing on co-operative lines in leaps and bounds in
Maharashtra.

As a result, some of the leaders from the GHA took the initiative and
formed the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Mandal (MGM) in Bombay, echoing
the demand of Goan Bahujan Samaj to merge Goa into Maharashtra and get
a lifetime of freedom from the nexus of landlords, moneylenders, and
bureaucrats.

Most of them were strong proponents of Marathi. The Bombay based
artists from the GHA were dominating the field of theatre, music,
dance, films, literature, etc. in Maharashtra. Adv Sushil Kavalekar,
one of the leading lawyers of Bombay and originally from Ponda, was
elected the President of the MGM, Bombay.

Shashikant Narvekar, a veteran journalist originally from Mapusa, as
well as Ramdas Prabhugaonkar, an artist originally from Loliem,
Canacona, were elected the general secretaries.[^11] 84-year old
Prabhugaonkar, who was the Secretary of the GHA for around 25 years,
told me an interesting anecdote in this regard. To celebrate the first
anniversary of the MGM, Bombay, they went to invite P K Atre,
popularly known as Pracharya Atre, one of the firebrand and fearless
leaders of Samyukta Maharashtra movement, as the Chief Guest of the
function.  To their surprise, he flatly refused to accept the
invitation, asking in his witty style why they wanted to merge Goa
into Maharashtra when “you have nothing to eat and I have nothing to
drink”. (Maharashtra government had imposed prohibition on liquor
consumption at that time). Interestingly, Pracharya Atre’s periodical
Maratha played a major role later during Goa’s Opinion Poll and Atre
himself addressed public meetings in Goa, supporting the merger.

[^11]: Interview with Ramdas Prabhugaonkar

While they were wondering whom to invite instead, Jagannath
Sukhatankar, a writer and their member, assured them that he would try
and get Dayanand Bandodkar, a businessman and social reformer from
Goa. Accordingly Bhau Bandodkar graced the function. He liked the name
of the organisation and commented: “*We are also trying to form a
political party in Goa. This name would suit us well.*”

## The Lion In The Making

But the MGP of Goa was neither an extension of the Bombay MGM nor an
initiative of Bandodkar. The wheels of the Assembly election had
started moving with the Parliament passing the Union Territories Act
1963 on 10 May. Union Home Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had also
announced that the first Assembly election for 30 seats including one
each of Daman and Diu, as well as the two Parliamentary seats, would
be held in the first week of December. The first democratically
government would be installed on the second anniversary of Goa’s
liberation − 19 December 1963.

Just eight months before the elections, the MGP was formed
in Goa.

Different groups in Goa had been discussing the formation of a
political alternative to the existing parties, especially the Congress
and the Praja Samajwadi Party. As said earlier, the youth in different
parts of Goa had constituted fronts to champion the cause of the
merger into Maharashtra and to seek freedom from land-enslavement. The
cause of the merger received a major boost with Vishwasrao Chowgule
launching Goa’s first Marathi daily *Gomantak* on 24 March 1962. He was
a mine owner who came from Marathi-speaking Belgaum and set up his
business in Goa during the Portuguese regime. B D Satoskar, the editor
of *Gomantak* and a Marathi writer, was a strong proponent of the
merger. Followed by this, Janardan Shinkre, another freedom fighter
from Ponda, launched the second Marathi daily Pradeep on 6 September
1962[^12] as a Free Voice of the people of Goa, without any strings
attached like the business interest of the Chowgules. The four-page
daily was priced at five paise.  Incidentally, both Satoskar and
Shinkre were Saraswat Brahmins, but of a firm view that landlordism
should come to an end and the tiller should be the owner of his own
land.

[^12]: प्रभू परेश वासुदेव; गोमंतकीय मराठी पत्रकारितेचा इतिहास, पान 213, 216

The person who took the initiative to bring all the promerger forces
under one common banner was Janardan Shinkre. While running his
pro-merger Front from Ponda, he realised that many people wanted to
join the cause but had their reservations about the National Congress
Goa. He discussed the matter with P P Shirodkar and both of them
convened a meeting of all the like-minded leaders at Mardol on 6
March 1963. Bandodkar was also invited to this meeting. PSP leader
Shivaji Desai proposed that a forum on the lines of Samyukta
Maharashtra Samiti be formed. But it was election time. The thought
boiled down to the forming of a political organisation and contesting
elections.[^13] Bandodkar proposed the name Maharashtrawadi Gomantak
Sanghatana, on the lines of the MGM in Bombay. It was agreed upon
unanimously.

Bandodkar was elected as the founder president of the MGS. By 7 April
1963, the National Congress Goa group led by P P Shirodkar had
formally merged into the MGM at a meeting held at Mardol. Eventually,
the MGS was registered as the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) and
the Election Commission of India allotted Lion as its symbol. This
Lion roared in the hearts of the Bahujan Samaj of Goa and ruled
uninterruptedly for the next 17 years.

A little before the first meeting held to form the MGS, a secret
meeting of non-Brahmin leaders was convened at the residence of
Tukaram Lolayekar, a businessman in Madgao, which was also attended by
Bandodkar as well as Narayan Karwarkar, the then president of Gomantak
Maratha Samaj, Rajaram Painginkar and Bhalchandra Kankonkar. The
proposal was to form a ‘Non-Brahmin Party’ on the lines of the Justice
Party of Madras. However, Bandodkar vehemently opposed the idea of
coming together based on a divisive agenda and creating an
anti-Brahmin front that would divide the Goan society on caste
lines. He strongly proposed that all the communities from the entire
state should work together under one banner.[^14] “Where did you find
this Bandodkar?” asked Raghunath Tople of Mapusa to Shinkre of Ponda
the day the MGS was formed. Shinkre told him: “He carries lots of
respect among the Bahujan Samaj.”[^15]

People knew Bandodkar in those days as a young businessman and mine
owner, who was generously donating funds for any good social cause,
especially in the educational and cultural fields. But very few people
knew what ideology he belonged to. Tarkateertha Lakshman Shastri Joshi
has revealed this in an article he has written on a book published on
Bhausaheb on the occasion of his 60th birthday:

> *“I met Bhausaheb Bandodkar in 1962. I was not aware that he knew me
> for the last 25 years. I was invited to Goa to inaugurate the Shetkari
> Parishad. I was put up at a bungalow on Altinho where I was welcomed
> by a smart-looking midage impressive personality called Dayanand
> Bandodkar, who was the mastermind behind the farmers’ conference. He
> had assigned his daughter Shashikala to look after me. He told me that
> during his stay in Bombay in 1942, he had heard all my speeches. At
> that time, I was the official spokesman of the Radical Democratic
> Party, founded by Com M N Roy (based on his Marxist philosophy of
> Radical Humanism). Bhau was attending my study circles on
> international politics, Marxism etc, held at our Dadar office. He had
> even heard M N Roy, was impressed with his lectures and had become a
> Royist himself. However, he stayed away from joining the party when
> the internal differences in the party came to the fore.”*[^16]

B D Satoskar, the first editor of *Gomantak*, says that Bhau gave credit
to Lokmanya Tilak for his mission of Charity.[^17] Sitaram Tengse, yet
another senior journalist and former Editor of Rashtramat, says that
many politicians in those days were inspired by Royist theory of
Humanism, including Maharashtra’s first chief minister Y B Chavan, D B
Karnik and especially veteran freedom fighter Com Shamrao Madkaikar in
Goa, who was very close to Bhau. Being a Marxist himself during his
student days, Tengse says Royism was much ahead of Communism, Royism
respected human sentiments, freedom of thought and efficiency of human
beings, irrespective of caste, creed or religion.[^18] According to
Amrut Kansar, Bhau was equally influenced by the reformist movements
of the 19th century in Maharashtra, led by Vithal Ramji Shinde,
Mahatma Phule, Shahu Maharaj, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar etc.[^19] The
concept of ‘Bahujan’ had evolved through these influences which Chavan
had implemented in Maharashtra and Bhau wanted it to be extended to
Goa, by merging it into Maharashtra.

[^16]: जोशी लक्ष्मणशास्त्री; अनेक तेजस्वी पैलू असलेले व्यक्तिमत्व (आमचे भाऊ, ना. भाऊसाहेब बांदोडकर षष्ठ्यद्विपूर्ती

This makes it crystal clear why Bhau opposed an anti-Brahmin party and
refused to be part of any organisation that would divide the Goan
society. For him, more than Marathi or Maharashtra, oppression of the
downtrodden classes was the real issue and ending the exploitative
system through democratic means was of paramount importance. However,
he and the MGP represented the feelings of the farming community from
the New Conquests. It was a different scenario altogether in the Old
Conquests, except for some parts of Bardez.

The MGP leadership did not realise that Marathi was an alien language
for the Christian farmers as well as the landless labourers from the
Old Conquests. Christians from the New Conquests were studying in the
Marathi schools, but they were not even one-fifth of Goa’s total
Christian population. The majority among the Christians lived in the
Old Conquests and were not at all comfortable with the thought of
merging their Goan identity into Maharashtra, calling themselves
Marathi.

The divide and rule policy of the Portuguese by suppressing the
development of Konkani was bearing fruits in the first election
itself.

## Morarji Versus Nehru

While mergerist forces were uniting under the banner of the MGP, union
home minister Morarji Desai paid a two-day visit to Goa, confusing the
whole issue further. At a crowded press conference held on 12 May
1963, he stated that all the union territories would be merged into
the larger neighbouring states sooner or later. This directly
contradicted the stand taken by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that
the distinct identity of union territories like Goa or Pondicherry
would be maintained for at least ten years, after which its future
would be decided by the people of those respective territories, not by
the central government.

It was a ‘shocking’ press conference. He dismissed the possibility of
restarting the lotteries, at the cost of revenue loss. At the cost of
even further revenue loss, he said liquor prohibition would also be
extended to Goa. He refused to accept the argument put forward by some
journalists that social drinking was part of Goan culture. He was not
sure that the territory’s economy would continue to be financially
viable, while making it clear that all kinds of taxation measures
would be extended to Goa shortly. And the final stroke in this
comment: “*The prime minister has never said that Goa would remain
separate if it succeeds in becoming self-sufficient.*”

Within 10 days, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the liberator of Goa,
arrived on a three-day visit, from 22 to 24 May 1963. He was one man
who had been consistently saying, even before liberation, that India
would maintain Goa’s distinct identity. The issue of merger had been
hounding Goa since 1940, and Nehru was the sole Congress leader who
had countered all kinds of pressures from his party colleagues,
especially from Maharashtra and to some extent from Karnataka, to
merge the territory which was half the size of any district of the
neighbouring states. But the Prime Minister had not left a single
opportunity to display his firmness. While addressing a rally of Goans
in Bombay on 4 June 1956, Nehru had said:

> *“What have we done in the French settlements? First of all, we have
> maintained their identity. We could easily or we can easily, in
> future, absorb them into the state of Madras or some district of
> Madras State. We do not propose to do that, because we want to
> maintain the individuality of Pondicherry and Karaikal. We want to
> maintain the type of French culture that has developed here, the
> French language that has developed there and they have complete
> freedom to continue their own laws, their educational apparatus and
> everything… So, here is an example for you which obviously would be
> applied by us to Goa when the time comes. I am saying this because
> some people are misled, either by false propaganda or by
> overenthusiastic people in India who say that Goa would be attached to
> Maharashtra or Karnataka Province… I hope you will be very friendly
> and cooperative neighbours.”*[^20]

[^20] Kelekar Ravindra; (Editor) Nation’s Solemn Commitments on Goa 1963

Nehru said this repeatedly in Bombay and also in the Parliament before
liberating Goa and even after finally making Goa a part of the Indian
Union through Operation Vijay, the military action. Perhaps this was
the reason he was greeted with a grand welcome everywhere, from the
time he landed in Goa on 22 May 1963 at 11.55 am at Dabolim till he
flew back from Vasco by helicopter on 24 May. During his threeday tour
from Dabolim to Panaji, Margao, Mapusa, Calangute, Bicholim, Old Goa,
Mangeshi, Ponda, and Vasco, no less than one and a half lakh Goans had
either gathered to listen to him or greet him while his motorcade was
passing through. Apart from the public rallies, he had three special
get-togethers with children in Panaji, Calangute, and Bicholim, a
meeting with newly elected panchas in Margao, and a special convention
of farmers in Ponda. On the first day itself, on the way to Panaji
from the airport, he had to face the first unscheduled stop at
Sancoale, where the locals disregarded police arrangements and
garlanded him. He was greeted at the airport by a crowd of over 10,000
and on the last day, when he had planned to meet citizens of Vasco
after visiting the Mormugao port and the naval base, the small
scheduled meeting had to be shifted to Tilak Maidan to control the
crowd of thousands, including women holding their babies in their
arms.[^21]

Nehru did not disappoint anybody. He kept the hopes of mergerists
alive by telling them at each and every rally as well as the press
conferences that after a decade Goans would be given an opportunity to
decide whether they wanted a merger or not. On the first day itself,
at a rally at Bandodkar Maidan in Panaji, Nehru allayed the fears
created by Morarji Desai a week before.

> *“There should be no hankering for Goa’s merger with this state or
> that. Goa should develop as it likes in the framework of India,
> particularly because Goa was potentially a rich place and it had all
> the makings of being a self-supporting state. If the Goans themselves
> brought about economic developments and raised the living standards,
> there was no reason why it should not function as a separate unit of
> federal India.”*[^22]

Goa and Goans proved this visionary right. Since 1987 Goa has thrived
as a self-sufficient State with the highest per capita income, highest
standard of living, and also topping several parameters like the
health index and more.

At the press conference, he also clarified on certain issues on which
Morarji had created panic. No liquor prohibition would be enforced in
Goa in the foreseeable future, he clarified.  He also assured that his
government did not want to impose on the Goans anything they
themselves did not desire.[^23] Here are some more statements Nehru
made either at the public rallies or the press conferences:

> I may say so.*
>

> unity of design of it, and yet l maintain the beauty of individual
> parts of it.”*

## The Media Blackout

Nehru had tried to awaken the Goan masses, but perhaps the Goan media
had a different agenda. Goa had four newspapers, including two
Portuguese dailies carried forward post-liberation, *O Heraldo* and *A
Vida*, besides *Gomantak*, the Marathi daily. A year later, on 18
February 1963, *The Navhind Times* was started by Dempo Group, Goa’s
leading mine owner and a prominent landlord. These two latest
newspapers had a significant mass reach among the newly educated
Goans, who could read English and/or Marathi. Both the newspapers very
skilfully blacked out Nehru on one important aspect he spoke
repeatedly at all his public rallies − his dream of Land to the
Tiller.

On the day he arrived in Goa, at a rally held at the Bandodkar
ground in Panaji, attended by around 30,000 people, he said:

> *“Apart from that the Portuguese here and if I may say so to some
> extent in their own country have developed a society which is
> completely out of date in the modern world. I am prepared to admit
> that our society in India is also out of date in a different sense,
> and we have to change it; but this change in ending of the Portuguese
> domination here necessarily resulted in changing many things. The
> changes are going on. And when a change happens in the social fabric,
> it has an upsetting feature.  It may ultimately be good; it may even
> immediately be good for many; but for some, it is upsetting. And I can
> well understand that.*
>
> *Now we do not want this change or any change to occur which causes
> harm or injury to the people, but sometimes it cannot be
> helped. Suppose, as in India, one of our major reforms has been
> putting an end to the big landlord system, the big zamindari system,
> because we thought it was bad for the peasantry and for the people
> generally to have this big landlord system. That is the common
> thinking all over the world today.  But in removing the zamindari
> system, the poor zamindars suffered. We gave them compensation and
> they said it was not enough. They suffered.*
>
> *When there is social change, it has to be faced. One tries to minimise

Nehru was clear in his thoughts about abolishing the ‘outdated’ feudal
system, which we called Bhatkarshai in Goa.  He was also blunt enough
to state that he could not help if it upset the existing system in
Goa. The next day, at a much bigger rally of around 30,000 in Margao,
he explained why abolishing the feudal system of Zamindari was the
need of the hour if we ha to progress and compete with other developed
countries:

> *"So we want to create a society in India which gives opportunity to
> everyone and which lessens greatly the differences that exist between
> the people, rich and poor: That is a difficult job, but it is a
> possible job and we are going to achieve it. It was not possible
> perhaps in the old days, but science has made progress, and science
> and technology have made it possible for us by our own labour to
> produce enough for everybody. That will take some time.*
>
> *You know how rich America is, how rich England and Germany and Japan
> are, and Russia? What is there in common between a capitalist country
> like America and Communist country like Russia? A common factor is
> that both depend on science and technology and both have made
> progress. Their Gods are science and technology. They may have
> different religions but the real Gods they worship are science and
> technology. And there is no capitalism in science and no communism in
> physics and chemistry and other things. It is just knowledge as such.*
>
> *And it is by that knowledge that they have progressed and it is by
> that knowledge that we shall progress. Science and the children of
> science, technology etc, that will tell us how to increase the wealth
> that we produce from the land, from industry, and that is the only
> way. We cannot produce wealth except by hard work and by understanding
> modern methods of working on land and for industry. It is not a thing
> by going to an astrologer that you get rich, or by other methods like
> that; it is hard work.*
>
> *So, we adopted, soon after freedom came to us we adopted this major
> method, this major approach, which we call the planning approach,
> thinking out what we should do. One of the first things we did was to
> put an end to the large landlords in India because they came in the
> way of the country’s progress. A bad agrarian system prevents a
> country from progressing, and that is the first thing that has to be
> removed. In Europe it was removed by bloody wars. In Japan it was
> removed after the last great war. Everywhere this is the first
> thing. So we had decided, even before independence, to remove it and
> we removed it and we have very largely succeeded. We want peasant
> proprietors on the land and you will remember that in our country 80
> percent of the people live in the villages. And our country will
> really only progress when the 80 percent progress. It is not the
> cities, big cities like Bombay and Calcutta and Delhi or Madras, that
> make a difference, but the villages that must progress. And therefore,
> we have to think of this general progress of the country- villages and
> towns and the like."*[^25]

Goa, at that time, was also 80 per cent rural. It was getting
educated. It was struggling. It was looking for an alternative economy
that would stop out-migrations of Goans for better prospects and
develop the existing geographical structure of Goa. Nehru had laid
down the plan before the people. And then when he went to Ponda the
same day to address Goa’s farmers, he even told them how to achieve
this goal:

*"In the olden days, we had a feudal system in India and all the land
was owned by zamindars, taluqdars, jagirdars and princes. The rest of
the people worked for them which was not right. That system has been
abolished. Now we want that the tillers of the soil should own the
land too. [Applause] It is gradually happening. It has already come to
pass to a very large extent. But it is not enough to have abolished
feudalism. We must increase production from land. We have to adopt the
right methods.*

*First of all, as I said, education of children is extremely important…
We have adopted the Panchayati Raj system to strengthen the
development programme… So now you will find that you do not have to
belong to a wealthy family or a high caste to attain some
position. Those who work hard and serve the country will be chosen for
their ability. No one will occupy high positions because of his birth
or connection… We want that the people of Goa should take the reins of
government into their own hands as it is being done in the rest of the
country…  You will elect representatives to the Lok Sabha in Delhi who
will participate in the law-making processes for the entire country.
Secondly, you will have your own legislature in Goa to which the
people will elect their representatives."*[^26]

It was a clear-cut election agenda he set for the people of
Goa. Abolish the feudal system of *Bhatkarshai*, let the tillers own
their land, educate their children, and learn modern technology. To
achieve this, elect your own representatives through elections and
start ruling Goa for the haves and the have-nots. Did the Congress
party adopt Nehru’s strategy to achieve this goal? We will deal with
this question in the next chapter on how the candidates were chosen
and what was the result of it.

## Landlords Rally Around The UGP

The core component of Nehru’s speeches did not go public through the
media, except for one day in *Gomantak*. But not less than one and a
half lakh people had heard him. It was discussed in the towns and the
villages, at the markets, tinttos, tea shops, taverns and practically
everywhere since the first election was at the doorstep. While the
farming community and the common Goan were in a cheerful mood, the
landlord community, across the religious lines, was quite upset. If
they didn’t pull up their sleeves, it could be the end of their
age-old hegemony and feudal rule.

On the other hand, the Christian community was getting restless over
the growing mood of merging Goa into Maharashtra. Though migrant
Christians were familiar with Marathi in Bombay, they were not
well-conversant with it. It was an alien language for Christians
living in Goa. Secondly, in a four-crore strong Maharashtra,
Christians were hardly six lakhs. Even if Goa had merged into
Maharashtra, it would be a drop in the ocean, with the Christian
population not able to cross two per cent. In Bombay, they had
experienced it while facing the domination of Gujaratis and Marathis.

As the elections approached, a tug of war began within the Congress
over allotment of tickets to some landlords, and the pro-merger lobby
started pressuring the party leadership. This uncertainty perhaps
created panic among the landlord class and they decided to align with
the Christian community, who were trying to mobilise the
anti-mergerist forces as a political alternative. In a shrewd manner
that is typical of the upper class Brahmins, the landlords across all
the religions decided to override the sentiments of the minority
community and pose a challenge to the movement of land reforms that
Nehru had spelt out in clear terms.

Hardly three months ahead of the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections
scheduled in the first week of December, on 13 September 1963, a
formal announcement was made of a new regional party. Five political
groups functioning in the Old Conquests came together under one common
banner − the United Goans Party (UGP). Most of the leaders either
belonged to Christian Brahmins (*Bamonn*) and Kshatriyas (*Chardo*),
owning land and/or were doctors, professors, or lawyers earlier
aligned with the erstwhile Portuguese rulers. The Hindu Brahmins from
Margao, the stronghold of Saraswat Brahmins, also joined hands with
them. John de Souza was the sole freedom fighter among them.

The oldest and biggest organisation among the five was Partido
Indiano, led by Dr Alvaro de Loyola Furtado, which had earlier
contested the ‘high-class’ Parliamentary elections during the
Portuguese regime. The party was founded by Alvaro’s
Portuguese-speaking grandfather. Dr Loyola Furtado was a prominent
Saxttikar Bhakar and equally respected doctor from Chinchinim. During
the Portuguese regime, he was known for his liberal views.

**A India Portuguesa* was Goa’s first weekly in Portuguese started in
1850 and was changed to A India after liberation. It was the
mouthpiece of Partido Indiano. After coming to power, in 1964, the MGP
government had imposed press censorship on its publication, alleging
that it favoured the Portuguese. It was later shut down. At that time,
however, it was run by Loyola Furtado’s daughter Leonor Loyola Furtado
e Fernandes.

Dotor Loyola Furtado, as he was popularly known in Saxtti, was chosen
as the founder president of the UGP.

Dr Jack de Sequeira, a 48-year old doctor and a landlord from Panaji,
had founded Goencho Pokx, during the same period. He was known for his
liberal views and courageous attitude.

The Goa National Union led by J M de Souza was pursuing with the
central government an entirely new democratic setup for Goa. He had
proposed a legislative council of 48 members, four each elected from
12 talukas (conselhos in Portuguese regime) and a cabinet of 12, one
each from a conselho, administered by the Centre. He had even met
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 10 January 1962 in this regard.

Besides this, there were also two other small groups, the United Front
of Goans led by Meilicio Fernandes and Democratic Party by Dr Joao da
Costa Pereira.[^27]

[^27]: The Navhind Times; 14 September 1963

Within three days, on 16 September the Sunday, the UGP had its first
public meeting at Saligao in Bardez. It was attended by around 500
people. Besides these five leaders, it was also addressed by Lima
Leitao, the Vasco-based lady mine owner and landowner; Sadashiv Desai,
a Bhatkar from Pernem as well as Jagdish Rao. Their prime attack was
on the Congress, blaming the party for Goans going through hardships
since liberation due to restrictions imposed on mining, banning of the
lottery, and curtailing imports. The speakers also cautioned the
people of the next probable step to prohibit consumption of liquor.

Incidentally, on the same day, the Congress President Purushottam
Kakodkar, Ligorio Cota Carvalho and Tulshidas Malkarnekar, in a
meeting organised by the Margao block, carried out a scathing attack
on the UGP. Calling it a communal party, they alleged that the leaders
had their selfish motives and had no interest in protecting the
interest of their community.[^28] In its meetings, the Congress
leaders also made fun of the Land to the Tiller demand made by the UGP
leaders. Since most of their leaders were wealthy Bhatkars, the
Congress leaders publicly asked if they agreed with the demand and
whether they would now personally hold the plough in their hands and
get into the field physically.[^29]

The UGP manifesto had land reforms and Tenancy Act as one of the prime
points, though in public meetings they mainly harped upon their
demands like Statehood for Goa and opposing merger of Goa into
Maharashtra.

Clear cut battle lines were thus drawn in Goa’s first historic
election where three major parties were crossing swords, the Congress,
the UGP, and the MGP. The battleground was The Land!
