<h3 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h3>
<h1 id="ajeeb-goa">AJEEB GOA</h1>
<p><em>Ajeeb hai yeh Goa-ke log</em><br />
(Strange are the people of Goa).</p>
<p>This quote is often attributed to the first Prime Minister of India, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. But it was not a statement he had made on any public platform. Chandrakant Keni, the former editor of the Rashtramat daily and one of the leading writers of Goa in the Konkani movement, is on record claiming that Nehru made this remark in a personal conversation when he met him in Delhi soon after Goa’s liberation in 1961. The observation was in the context of the proposed merger and Goa’s languages. At that point of time, when several regions in India were demanding the formation of separate smaller states on linguistic grounds, a large chunk of Goans were demanding that tiny Goa be merged into the much bigger neighbouring state of Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Their argument was that the Marathi language of Maharashtra was their mother tongue and that the Konkani that they spoke was its dialect. The large populace of the Hindu Bahujan Samaj, who had never studied Marathi, claimed that Marathi was their mother tongue, despite not being able to speak, read, or write in this language fluently. They could only understand it to the extent of singing prayers or bhajans and watching Marathi dramas. Many illiterate Goans even performed dramas in “not-so-pure” Marathi.</p>
<p>Contrary to this, quite a sizeable number of Hindus (especially from the wealthy upper caste Brahmin community), who had studied in the Marathi medium and were fluent in it, claimed that Konkani was their mother tongue. It was this section that eventually played a crucial role in convincing the Hindu community of how the merger would be suicidal for Goa. And yet there was a strange double-speak within the Brahmins. There was one place where no non-Brahmin community, which claimed that Marathi was their mother tongue, could interfere. Goa’s major temples were, and still are, controlled by the Brahmins. But till date, these temples display Marathi boards: पादत्राणे बाहेर ठेवावीत, कृपया शांतता पाळा (Keep your footwear outside, Silence please) etc. Even the minutes of their meetings are largely written in Marathi or, in recent years, in English, but not in Konkani.</p>
<p>And what about the Christians, who amounted to 38 per cent of Goa’s population in the 1960s? The proposed merger was a real threat to their existence. They were not at all familiar with Marathi. Secondly, if Goa had merged, they would have been lost in the ocean of Hindu-dominated Maharashtra as a negligible non-entity of barely two per cent.</p>
<h2 id="no-to-merger-yes-to-maharashtrawadi">No To Merger, Yes To Maharashtrawadi</h2>
<p>The issue of Goa’s merger originated in 1940, much before the state of Maharashtra was created, Goa was liberated, and even before India attained independence. Yet, see what the majority of Goans stated when it came to spelling out their mother tongue at the Census conducted in 1961:</p>

<p>So what was it then? A socio-cultural issue or a purely political matter? For soon after liberation, this sentiment got translated into a political reality. In the run up to the first ever Assembly election held in 1963, the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) was founded, with the aim of merging Goa into Maharashtra. To everyone’s surprise, the party came to power by winning a majority of the seats. The ‘anti-merger Konkani camp’, led by the United Goans Party (UGP), was pushed to the Opposition benches. And the Congress, which had been day-dreaming of ruling Goa, but had not taken a firm stand on the language and merger issue, got completely wiped out in the first election.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the majority of Goans supported Goa’s merger into Maharashtra? Well, the MGP leaders from Goa, the Maharashtrian leaders belonging to the Congress, as well as the Socialists claimed it was a mandate in favour of the merger. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru refused to buy this argument. Later, in 1967, the Opinion Poll was held to decide the issue of the merger. It stands today as the only referendum ever held in the Indian Republic. The first Assembly was dissolved midway. So no elected government existed at the time of the Poll. The Opinion Poll was a unique ‘election’. There was no party and no candidate. Just two symbols: Flower for merger and Two Leaves for anti-merger (officially, for Union Territory). What was the result? The same electorate, within three years of voting for the pro-merger MGP, voted against the merger.</p>
<p>Till then the MGP had been ruling the state with 16 seats, and the UGP had 12. But in the Opinion Poll, 16 constituencies voted against the merger while only 12 voted for the merger. Exactly the opposite! And the Flower polled fewer votes in 10 MGP bastions than what the pro-merger party had polled in the first Assembly poll. Contrary to this, Two Leaves polled more votes in all the 28 constituencies as compared to what the UGP had polled in the Assembly poll. This was simply amazing!</p>
<p>Even more amazing was the result of the Assembly election held within a month of the Opinion Poll. After keeping Goa separate, the same <em>Ajeeb</em> voter once again elected the pro-merger MGP back to power with a clear majority. The chief proponent of the merger, Bhausaheb Bandodkar (as the first Chief Minister of Goa Dayanand Balkrishna Bandodkar was popularly called), was back in the saddle. And Dr Jack de Sequeira, considered the Father of the Opinion Poll, was back on the opposition benches!</p>
<p>The issue of the merger was resolved. Bandodkar’s MGP even supported a private resolution in the Assembly, demanding Statehood for Goa. But the language controversy continued to rage on. Twenty years later in 1986 Goa witnessed the most violent agitation after its Liberation, which lasted for 555 days. The controversy was over the demand to also make Marathi the Official Language of Goa along with Konkani. The argument was the same. Marathi is the language and Konkani is its dialect.</p>
<p>By that time, many bigwigs from the MGP and UGP had joined the Congress. The national party was in power but was strongly divided over the Official Language issue. The people’s agitation also polarised the political forces based on Konkani and Marathi. Shashikala Kakodkar’s Bhausaheb Bandodkar Gomantak Party (BBGP) staged a homecoming and joined the MGP. Dr Wilfred de Souza’s rebel group of Goa Congress got merged into the Congress. Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane was leading the group supporting the cause of Marathi. When there was no option but to resolve the issue amicably, the Congress high command played with words in the Official Language Act. “Konkani was made the official language and Marathi was also allowed to be used for official purposes.”</p>
<p>In reality, English continues to dominate as the official language. Yet, strangely, the Konkani-Marathi language controversy still hounds Goan politics even today, after 60 years! The major switch however was on the election front. Since Goa now had its own official language, on 30 May 1987, Goa was unanimously granted Statehood by the Parliament. The number of Assembly constituencies rose from 28 to 40. The four talukas in the Old Conquests, which were at the forefront in support of Konkani, became a dominant force with 22 Assembly seats, which was more than half of the total seats. And the remaining seven talukas in the New Conquests, where Marathi had majority support, got only 18 seats. This changed the whole equation of Goa’s election politics.</p>
<p>In the first Assembly election of the State of Goa held in 1989, Congress was voted back to power. The so-called ‘united house’ won 20 out of 40 seats: 15 in the Old Conquests and 5 in the New Conquests. The party also gained nearly 41 per cent votes. Since then, to date, Congress has never been able to cross this polling figure. Except for once in 1999, it has not touched the magic figure of 21 in the 40-member House.</p>

<li>1980 shows seats won by Cong (U). Cong (I) did not win a single seat</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1963 the same voter had wiped out the Congress when it was ‘united but divided’ on the issues of language and merger. Twenty-six years later, in 1989, the same Goan voter stood behind this national party, which was ‘united but divided’ on the language issue. In the first election, the Goan voter had elected the MGP to power. Two-and-a-half decades later, the Marathiwadi party was pushed to the opposition benches with only 18 seats in the 1989 election. That was the beginning of the end of the MGP era.</p>
<p>This is not just one instance of the ‘strange’ behaviour of Goan voters. Tossing all conventional yardsticks of electioneering in Indian democracy to the winds, Goan voters have time and again proved that they are Ajeeb, from the first Assembly election of 1963 up to the most recent polls held in 2017. So strange has been the behaviour of the Goan voter that even seasoned politicians and political analysts go completely wrong in forecasting the election results.</p>
<h2 id="the-love-hate-for-the-congress">The Love-Hate for the Congress</h2>
<p>There was an even more vigorous justification for Pandit Nehru to call Goans <em>Ajeeb</em> Log. He has always been a heroic figure for the people of Goa, right from the days of the Indian freedom struggle. And then as a messiah, who sent an army to Goa in 1961 to liberate them from the 451-years-long rule of the Portuguese colonialists. In January 1937, during Portuguese rule, news spread that Nehru’s aeroplane would land in Goa to refuel. Thousands of people gathered at the naval airport just to see Nehru. He was not allowed to meet the people, but he came out onto the open ground, waved at them, and flew back. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> And when he arrived on a three-day visit to Free Goa, from 23 to 25 May 1963, over a lakh people greeted him all along the roads he travelled to Margao, Mapusa, Bicholim, Calangute, and Ponda. And each public rally drew crowds of not less than 20,000 to 30,000 enthusiastic Goans.</p>
<p>But when his party went for the first ever Assembly poll within seven months of his maiden visit, the Nehru-loving Goans made all his 28 candidates bite the dust. The seven month old MGP was elected to power and the three-month old UGP became the opposition. Our senior journalist colleagues tell me that the party was so confident of victory that the Congress leaders had even distributed ministerial portfolios amongst themselves. The shattered leadership did not dare to contest the next election of 1967, held after the Opinion Poll. The national party contested the 1972 poll, but only to repeat history and reduce its polling percentage from 13 to 10 per cent in Goa (excluding Daman &amp; Diu).</p>
<p>The renowned political analyst Prof Ram Joshi, while analysing Goa’s historic first election, had compared it to Kerala’s polls. Goa was the second state in the country, after Kerala, to have a non-Congress government.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>But the Kerala election result had not been as stunning as Goa’s. In the first election held in 1957 the Communist Party of India swept the polls by winning 60 out of 126 seats and seized the throne. The Congress did win 43 seats. And in the second election held in 1960 the Congress rose to 63 seats and formed the government by joining hands with the 20-strong Praja Socialist Party. Within two years the PSP’s Chief Minister Pattom Thanu Pillai was appointed as Governor of Punjab, and R Sankar, the deputy chief minister belonging to the Congress, was made the CM. But in the first election of Goa, Daman and Diu, the Congress could win only one seat in Daman and not a single one in Goa. Almost 19 bigwigs out of 28 candidates lost their deposits. And in the third election of 1972, eight candidates of the national party lost their deposits.</p>

<p>The <em>Ajeebi</em> of Goan voters does not end here.</p>
<p>When did the Congress eventually make its debut in the Goa Assembly? When the Indian voter, in a nationwide wave, ended the 26-year long unabated Congress rule, headed by Nehru’s daughter Indira Gandhi. It was the election held after the 21 months of Emergency, a time considered to be the darkest period in Indian democracy. The then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, claiming internal disturbance, had declared Emergency on 25 June 1975. She had cancelled elections and suspended civil liberties. Most of her opponents and several eminent journalists were thrown behind bars. The Press was censored. Human rights violations became the order of the day, including the notorious mass-level forced sterilisation to control the population, spearheaded by Indira’s then powerful younger son, Sanjay Gandhi.</p>
<p>When the terror-filled Emergency was lifted on 21 March 1977 and fresh elections for Lok Sabha were announced, all the non-Congress parties came together along with the Congress rebels. They formed the Janata Party and contested on the symbol of Charan Singh’s Bharatiya Lok Dal. The BLD swept the election by winning 295 seats in the 542-strong Lok Sabha while the Lefts won 29 more. Indira’s Congress could win only 154 Lok Sabha seats. South Goa was one among them. The North Goa seat went to the MGP. The BLD candidates were pushed to third position in both the constituencies of Goa, with a vote share of a mere 15 per cent. The Congress and the MGP polled 40 per cent each.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Simultaneously, the election was also held for the Goa Assembly. Its term had actually expired on 24th March, but was extended due to the Emergency. The MGP was in the saddle with Shashikala Kakodkar succeeding her father, Bhausaheb Bandodkar, after his sudden demise in 1973. The UGP, however, had split and a majority group of seven legislators led by Anant alias Babu Naik had joined the Congress before the Emergency was declared. The three-member UGP led by Dr Jack de Sequeira joined the Janata Party before the elections. On the other hand, Revenue Minister Pratapsingh Rane had stepped down from the MGP cabinet, resigned from the party and joined the Congress.</p>

<p>Almost seven former UGP candidates and Rane from the MGP contested on Congress tickets while also roping in young candidates from their respective former party cadres. Due to this, despite the anti-Congress wave throughout India (and even in Goa), the Congress party made its debut in the Goa Assembly with 10 MLAs. Three among them were former MLAs − Babu Naik, Pratapsingh Rane, and Leo Velho. Strange, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Only three candidates of the Janata Party won, one of them being Dr Sequeira himself. The other two were veteran freedom fighter Madhav Bir in Panaji and Ferdino Rebello in Cuncolim. Rebello later quit politics, rose in his legal profession as a high court judge and retired as the Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court. The MGP won 15 seats, and Shashikala alias Tai continued to rule Goa. The impact of the Emergency was limited to getting three legislators of the Janata Party elected, polling around 23 per cent of the votes. The party was pushed to third position in almost 17 constituencies out of all the 28 seats it contested in Goa. Twelve candidates lost their deposits. The prime battle was between the MGP and the Congress. The next election was even more dramatic in the history of the Congress party, for Goa, as well as India.</p>
<p>Due to the rebellion within the ruling MGP and even within the cabinet, the Tai government was pushed to minority status within a year and ten months. Rather than handing over the reins of power to the rebel, Tai managed to convince Prime Minister Morarji Desai to impose President’s Rule and hold fresh elections in 1979. As Goa entered President’s Rule on 27th April, the infighting within the ruling Janata Party also led to the premature dissolution of the Lok Sabha on 22 August 1979.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>The Congress, on the other hand, had also split vertically as Congress (Indira) and Congress (Urs). Opposing Indira Gandhi’s move to bring her son Sanjay back into the leadership, Karnataka Chief Minister Devraj Urs split the party and took away several prominent leaders with him, especially from Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Goa. They included veteran leaders like Yeshwantrao Chavan, Sharad Pawar, A K Antony, Devkant Barua, Brahmananda Reddy, Priyaranjan Das Munshi, P J Kurien, Swaran Singh, Karan Singh, and even Ambika Soni.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> All the Congress MLAs in Goa also joined the rebel Congress (Urs).</p>
<p>Fresh elections for the Goa Assembly were held along with the Lok Sabha poll in January 1980. Indira Gandhi once again emerged as the leader by sweeping the polls in spite of the background of the three-year old Emergency and a major rebellion. Congress (I) won 353 seats with a vote share of 43 per cent. On the other hand, Congress (U) could win only 13 seats with a vote share of a mere five per cent; 143 of their candidates could not even save their deposits.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>But in Goa, it was exactly the opposite in the Assembly poll. Despite the seat sharing arrangements between the Congress (I) and Congress (U), the Indira-led Congress could not win a single seat out of only six seats it had contested. Four of these candidates even lost their deposits. Congress (Urs) however swept the poll by winning 20 out of 22 contested seats. It not only emerged as the single largest party in the Goa Assembly but broke all the election records of all the ruling parties in the past. The winners included nine former MLAs and three rebels from the Maharashtrawadi camp − Dayanand Narvekar (Tivim), Dilkhush Desai (Rivona) and Vasu Paik Gaonkar (Canacona).</p>
<p>MGP’s long rule had come to an end. The Lion King was left with the scanty manes of seven legislators. Three independents defeated three MGP stalwarts, including former CM Shashikala tai, who bit the dust against Harish Zantye, a young businessman from Bicholim selling cashew nuts. Both the factions of the Janata Party were completely wiped out from Goa politics. In 1977 the Congress had entered the Goa Assembly during a nationwide anti-Congress ‘Janata Wave’, and now, Devaraj Urs was celebrating victory in Goa, even as the rest of the nation witnessed an ‘Indira Wave’.</p>
<p>Those who were left in the MGP were Ramakant Khalap (Mandrem), Deu Mandrekar (Pernem), Vishnu Rama Naik (Pale), Vinayak Chodankar (Cumbarjua), Babuso Gaonkar (Madkai), Narsinhbai Tandel (Daman) and Somji Solanki (Diu). Reduced to just five seats in Goa!</p>
<p>But the <em>Ajeebi</em> was not over. The climax was yet to come. Overnight, all the 30 legislators of Goa, Daman and Diu − 20 of Cong (U), seven MGP men, and three independents − decided to jump the wagon and join the Congress (Indira) en masse. Even the defeated Shashikala joined the Congress by merging the MGP into the national party. It would have been a strange record in India’s Parliamentary history. All the elected legislators en masse joined a party that had suffered a miserable defeat in the election in Goa. But at the last minute two MGP legislators, Ramakant Khalap and Babuso Gaonkar, dropped out of the plan and kept the mane-less Lion alive.</p>
<p>With this action-packed drama which was more exciting than a Rajinikanth movie, the Congress came to power for the first time in the history of Goa. Since then, up to 2017, the Congress has faced a series of defections aimed at forming alternate governments. It is equally important to note that the first Congress government in Goa was the outcome of the most sensational defection of its kind, between two parties that were rivals to each other. And the Goan voter continued to elect these ‘defectors’ in every subsequent election, rewarding them as the most loyal soldiers of the Indian National Congress!</p>
<p>What else do we need to prove the Ajeeb-ness of the Goan!</p>
<h2 id="castes-dont-cast-votes-in-goa">Castes Don’t Cast Votes in Goa</h2>
<p>Even after 75 years of independence, the electoral politics of India are synonymous with caste politics, may they be in Aryan North India or the Dravidian South. Political parties battle not over ideology or even religion, but over caste, to win the elections. The chief minister too, in most cases, is chosen on the basis of caste, and not on his or her capability to run the state. The tragedy of Indian democracy continues.</p>
<p>In Goa, caste bias still prevails, not only among the Hindus but within the Christians as well. When the Portuguese conquered Goa in 1510, they followed a policy of religious conversion to maintain control of their overseas territories. Thus a large number of Goan Hindus became Christians, bringing along with them their respective castes.</p>
<p>On seeing that the neo-Christians were not giving up their Hindu customs even after conversion, the Portuguese then established the Inquisition in 1560. It was defined as an ecclesiastical tribunal for the suppression of heresy and punishment of heretics.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> Its activities ceased for a while in 1774, due to the efforts of Marquis de Pombal, the liberal Prime Minister of Portugal. It was revived five years later and finally abolished in 1812.</p>
<p>The two-and-a-half-century-long period of the Inquisition is considered to be one of the most inhuman and brutal times in the history of humankind. Much before the religious conversions began, Afonso de Albuquerque who conquered Goa in 1510 had forbidden the so-called ‘holy’ practice of Sati in Goa. He had termed the practice of a wife burning herself alive on the pyre of her dead husband as inhuman. But during the Inquisition, thousands of neo-Christians were burnt alive worldwide as a punishment, while calling it the ‘Holy’ Inquisition!</p>
<p>Aiming to customise the neo-Christians to western culture, the Portuguese had banned all the Indian rituals and customs followed by them during marriages and other festivities, and even certain eating and dressing habits in day-to-day life. But the caste system was not abolished. The colonial rulers found it convenient to rule a divided house. Thus even among the Christians, the upper caste Brahmins and goldsmiths continued as Bammon, the Kshatriyas (or Chadde) as Chardos and other lower caste people as Sudir, which means Shudras. The sub castes also exist. The tribal class became Kristão Gauddo. The caste hierarchies are followed so strictly in Goa that even today many inter-caste marriages are opposed. Interestingly, inter-religious common-caste marriages, as between Hindu Brahmins and Christian Bamonn, are not frowned upon.</p>
<p>The inequality based on caste discrimination continues to prevail among the Hindus as well as the Christians even after five centuries in the social and cultural sphere of Goa. But, strangely, it does not figure in electoral politics. Neither among the Christians nor the Hindus.</p>
<p>According to Adv Radharao Gracias, a former MLA and a political analyst, caste never mattered for the Christian community in elections. The lower caste Christians, who were not well educated in the first two decades after liberation, did not venture much into politics. They stood firmly behind the educated upper caste leaders from Bamonn and Chardo communities, as the elections moved around identity issues like the language and merger of Goa. The Sudir community began to contest elections in large numbers from the ‘80s, but still caste never became a dominant feature among Christians in electoral politics.</p>
<p>Contrary to this, caste does matter among Hindus, even in the elections. Attempts on caste lines are made even today. Hindu politicians try to win over voters by displaying their caste and community cards, albeit discreetly. After all the benefit of this is not more than five to ten per cent. However, since Goa’s Assembly constituencies are just 20,000 to 25,000 strong, the little difference of 5-10 per cent made by exploiting caste, religion, money, or muscle power often makes a big difference to winning a seat. Nonetheless, it’s a tightrope walk for each and every candidate not to have a caste-identity on the whole, to win over voters from all castes and religions, and still garner a few game-changing votes based on caste to have an edge over their rivals. By and large, it has been a vote based on conscience rather than caste or community. The winnability factors are education, social status, performance, competence, capacity to deliver, etc., but certainly not caste or religion.</p>
<p>This has been the trend right from the beginning. In the first election, the highest number, of 83 per cent votes, was polled by freedom fighter Vasant Velingkar of the MGP in Madkai. He belonged to the Devdasi community known as the Gomantak Maratha Samaj. This community numbered barely 500 in Madkai. He polled 7000 votes, in which the Bhandari vote was around 70 per cent and Hindu Gauda was around 25 per cent. He vacated the seat for Dayanand Bandodkar (GMS once again) to contest the by-election and Bhau polled 93 per cent of the votes, perhaps a record in Goa’s electoral history till date.</p>
<p>In 1972, Bhau shifted to Mandrem, where again the GMS community is still counted only in hundreds, around two per cent. Before him, in 1967, Mandrem was represented by Anthony D’Souza of the MGP, where the Christians number just 10 to 15 per cent. Half of Mandrem is populated by the Bhandari Samaj. But to date, no Bhandari has been elected from Mandrem on caste lines. Dayanand Sopte, a Bhandari, was voted to power in 2017 by riding the anti-Laxmikant Parsekar (ex-Chief Minister) wave. Sopte had been defeated earlier in 2012 by BJP’s Parsekar. Six-time MLA Khalap, three-time MLA Parsekar and one-time MLA Sangeeta Parab − all belonged to the Maratha community, which has a sizeable presence of one third in Mandrem, but certainly not enough to win the election purely on caste lines, that too when Maratha candidates cross swords with each other.</p>
<p>An interesting episode took place just before the 1972 election. Bhau faced a revolt led by Krishnanath Baburao Naik, popularly known as KB Naik, the then leader of the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj, who had been elected in a by-election from Shiroda. The vacancy had been created as the elected candidate, former minister Vitthal Subrai ‘ViSu’ Karmali, had committed suicide, apparently for not being made a minister again. The ‘firebrand’ KB and ‘autocratic’ Bhau developed serious differences. KB Naik joined hands with other like minded colleagues, and seven MLAs including two ministers − Anthony D’Souza and Gopalrao Mayekar − withdrew support to the MGP government on 28 July 1970. The others were Deputy Speaker Manju Gaonkar, K B Naik, Dattaram Chopdekar, Gajanan Patil and co-opted MLA Jiva Gaonkar. They were the educated and respected cream of the Bahujan Samaj. The MGP government was reduced to a minority. To save his government, Bhau engineered the first defection in the history of Goa. During a vote of confidence in the Assembly, five UGP MLAs led by Orlando Sequeira supported the MGP government. Bhau won the vote by 17 to 14 votes<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This two-month long rebel saga was fully backed by Madhav Gadkari, the editor of the leading Marathi daily Gomantak. This newspaper’s headlines lambasted Bhau and he was roundly condemned as an autocratic dictator at the largely attended public meetings held by the MGP rebels. Serious charges like financial malpractices were made against him, and he was also attacked for no longer supporting the cause of the merger.</p>
<p>This led to the formation of a parallel MGP, called the Nav Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (NMG), led by KB Naik, to contest the 1972 election. Three MGP MLAs, including the two rebels Anthony D’Souza and Gopalrao Mayekar, joined hands with the Congress. The third one was Gopal Apa Kamat, the Sattari MLA. NMG fielded 14 candidates. On the other hand, the UGP had also split into two factions: UGP (Sequeira Group) and UGP (Orlando Group). The Congress was back in the fray with 19 candidates. The RSS-backed Bharatiya Jan Sangh made its debut in the Goa election by fielding nine candidates. The Communist Party of India (CPI) also took part.</p>
<p>The NMG was expecting that around half of the Bhandari Samaj would support KB, who even had the potential to become the Chief Minister. Bhau’s Gomantak Maratha Samaj comprised hardly two per cent of the Hindu population. And what was the outcome of this multi-cornered fight? The Goan voter wiped out the Congress once again (they won only the Daman seat, as in 1963) giving them only 14 per cent votes. Both the rebel groups − the NMG and UG (Orlando) − were rejected outright by the Goan electorate. They polled barely four per cent of the votes. Jan Sangh and the CPI − the rightists and the leftists – fared worse, not securing even one per cent.</p>
<p>And to everyone’s surprise, Bhau’s MGP emerged victorious for the third consecutive time, with more shining colours this time. The party polled 38 per cent of the vote, gaining 18 seats. Close to it, once again, was the UG (Sequeira) party, with 33 per cent of the votes, but with only 10 legislators. The MGP also won the Panaji seat (Baban Naik, belonging to the Gomantak Maratha Samaj) and Curchorem (Anil Prabhudesai, a Kshatriya Maratha). All the caste equations had been tossed to the wind.</p>
<p>There are many episodes like this in the history of Goa’s elections. Yet another is noteworthy. It was during the 1980 election. The MGP era had ended, the Congress was rising and Vasu Paik Gaonkar from Canacona, the first ever candidate from the Kunbi-Velip tribe, was contesting on the ticket of a party other than the MGP. He had joined the Congress (U) with other MGP rebels. Manohar Prabhudesai, my father, was at the forefront of the damage control measures along with a Cuncolim-based strongman, Shabu Desai. As I was told in my student days, the MGP fielded Eknath Namshikar, a humble businessman from the Kharvi (fisherfolk) community, since that was an equally large community, like the tribals in Canacona. My father and Shabu-dad went around Gaodongri, Khotigao, and Khola, the tribal dominated villages, called all the villagers to Gaonkar’s house, gave him some token money as a traditional gesture and the Gaonkar (the community head) swore by keeping his hand on a coconut (Shrifal) that they would vote for the Lion.</p>
<p>The result? Congress candidate Vasu Paik Gaonkar garnered 70 per cent of the votes, the highest number he ever polled in his political career of being a four-time MLA from 1977 to 1989. His victory margin was over 5000 votes. The MGP could pull in barely a third of the votes. Later, when I entered journalism, I was told by Dr Kashinath Jalmi that a decision in this regard had been taken at a state-level meeting of all the organisations of Hindu and Christian tribals. No matter which party the candidate belonged to, the community should wholeheartedly vote and send the maximum number of tribals to the Assembly. It was not caste politics. The tribals had their socio-economic issues like Cumeri cultivation, etc., and they needed a united voice to resolve it.</p>
<p>The situation today is exactly the opposite in Canacona. The real strength of Isidore Fernandes, the three-time MLA of Canacona (and Poinguinim), lies in the tribals of Gaodongri and Khotigao, while Ramesh Tawadkar, a tribal, enjoys more support among other communities than his own. Similarly, MGP President Deepak Dhavalikar, a Padhye Brahmin, won in Priol for two consecutive terms by defeating two powerful tribal candidates, two-time BJP MLA Vishwas Satarkar in 2007 and the present MLA Govind Gaude in 2012. His elder brother and five-time MLA Sudin Dhavalikar is virtually the King of Madkai, winning all the elections since 1999 till date. The largest population in his constituency, almost 70 per cent, is of the Bhandari community, alongside a sizeable Gauda population. But neither a Bhandari leader like Shripad Naik, Ramchandra Mule, Ravi Naik’s son Ritesh, nor a tribal leader like Govind Gaude has defeated him till date.</p>
<h2 id="the-minority-cms">The ‘Minority’ CMs</h2>
<p>Precisely due to this broad mind-set, Goa was not overly concerned with having a chief minister belonging to the majority caste or community. Most of the chief ministers Goa has had till date have belonged to the communities having a presence of five per cent or lesser. The table below is a testimony to the fact that even when Goa was not fully literate in the first two decades, it was simply the indisputable rule of two CMs − Bhausaheb Bandodkar and his daughter Shashikala (Tai) Kakodkar. They belonged to the Gomantak Maratha Samaj (GMS), which comprises just two per cent of Goa’s Hindu population. Goans till date respect the commendable 16-year long rule of the MGP, led by these two legends. Ramakant Khalap, otherwise an arch rival of Tai within the MGP, has recently made a public statement that she was one of the most non-corrupt chief ministers of Goa.</p>
<p>They were succeeded by Pratapsingh Rane of the Congress, who belonged to the Kshatriya Maratha community. Though the community comprises 15 per cent among the Hindus, Rane belongs to the upper strata of the Kshatriyas, Shhannav Kulli Sardar, which numbers not more than five per cent. He has been the longest serving chief minister of Goa and has generally been the ‘unanimous’ choice in the Congress party. Many a time he has been the ‘compromise’ candidate, amid the infighting of various groups within the Congress.</p>
<p>While the anti-Brahmin sentiment was quite strong during the first three to four decades, the 21st century saw two chief ministers belonging to the 2.5 per cent Brahmin community − Manohar Parrikar of the BJP and Digambar Kamat of the Congress. Goa’s Bahujan Samaj and even the Christian community rallied behind them without any hesitation and they ruled for many full terms.</p>

<p>• Chief Ministers gaining office via defections are not included in the above list</p>
<p>Goa had only one Christian chief minister by popular vote. Luizinho Faleiro rose to that position when the Congress achieved the magic figure of 21 in the 40-member House in 1999. Other Christian chief ministers were the leaders of defecting Congressmen, who either joined hands with the MGP or the BJP to rule Goa. It all began in 1990, when Rane was toppled within 75 days during his third term as the CM. These chief ministers were Churchill Alemao (18 days), Dr Luis Proto Barbosa (eight months) and Dr Wilfred de Souza (seven months) with MGP’s support; Dr de Souza (four months) again in 1994 with MGP support and BJP’s support from outside; and Francisco Sardinha (11 months) with BJP’s support in 1999.</p>
<p>Besides Manohar Parrikar, the BJP also had two other chief ministers, belonging to the Maratha community, but again not by popular vote. Laxmikant Parsekar (2 years, 4 months) became the chief minister when Parrikar had to step down to become India’s defence minister. Dr Pramod Sawant is presently ruling Goa since March 2019 after Parrikar’s demise.</p>
<p>Interestingly, those who played caste politics to establish their dominion were never preferred by the voters or chosen as the ‘popular choice’ to head the governments. For instance, Bhandari is the largest community among Hindus in Goa − almost 43 per cent. But Ravi Naik, the sole Bhandari who became a CM, could grab the throne only when he jumped out of his party and joined hands with other defectors. Certainly not by popular vote. Shripad Naik is not highly favoured by the BJP cadres, most of whom belong to the Bahujan Samaj. Desperate attempts to unite the Bhandaris have been going on since 1972 till date, but have not yielded any fruit. In the background of the forthcoming 2022 election, the Gomantak Bhandari Samaj has had a crucial organisational election, which has a hidden political agenda, but cannot spell it out publicly.</p>
<p>So baffling and ineffective are the caste politics of Goa!</p>
<h2 id="religion-counts-but-doesnt-matter">Religion Counts, but Doesn’t Matter</h2>
<p>Goa is an attractive tourist destination for visitors worldwide, and there are some weird misconceptions spread about this land. One of them is that Goa is a westernised Christian state, a Rome of the East. It is an impression easily gained when a tourist travels only along the Goan coastline, especially through Baga, Anjuna, Calangute, Miramar, Colva, Benaulim, and other beach villages. Except for Mandrem and Morjim in the northern Pernem taluka and Agonda and Palolem in Canacona taluka in the south, most of the coastline is Christian-dominated and is ‘being westernised’ to please the tourists. In reality, Christians comprise only 25 per cent of Goa’s total population today. And even in 1961, at the time of liberation, it was just 38 per cent. Goa has a larger Hindu population (66 per cent), with Muslims comprising eight per cent.</p>
<p>Goa is primarily and historically divided into two regions: The Old Conquests and the New Conquests. The Portuguese did not rule over the entire state of Goa for 451 years as commonly believed. They did rule for that period over only one-fifth of the area of present-day Goa. After several battles, they established their power over four talukas of today’s Goa: Bardez, Tiswadi (Ilhas), Salcete, and Mormugao, in the 16th century. These were called the Velhas Conquistas (Old Conquests). The Novas Conquistas (New Conquests) which were conquered in the second half of the 18th century, after over 250 years, are Ponda, Sanguem, Quepem, Canacona, Bicholim, Pernem, and Sattari. The newest taluka, Dharbandora, is now being carved out from Sanguem. The New Conquests, four-fifths of Goa, were ruled by the Portuguese for less than 200 years!</p>
<p>It is often said that the Portuguese arrived in India with a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other. Religious conversion was officially sanctioned by the King of Portugal. Accordingly, the majority population in the Old Conquests was converted to Christianity. However, when the colonialists conquered the New Conquests in the 18th century, the Portuguese had changed their policy and there was an agreement reached on not carrying out conversion activities. Since then, the Old Conquests are Christian-dominated while the New Conquests have a majority Hindu population. Therefore, religion does count in Goa politics in terms of votes even today due to the demographic divide. The majority Christians are concentrated in the Old Conquests while the Hindus are more in the New Conquests. But when it comes to actually choosing your MLA, the religion doesn’t matter. What matters once again is the education, social status, performance, competence, capacity to deliver, etc.</p>
<p>During the Portuguese regime and especially after Goa’s independence, the four major towns of Goa prospered − Mapusa and Margao in terms of commercial activity, Vasco port due to mining, and Panaji as the capital of Goa. The coastal belt prospered too, as Goa’s prime tourism area, especially from the ‘80s onwards. These factors resulted in the urbanisation of the New Conquests as well as significant in-migration of people from all over India. On the other hand Christians from the Old Conquests began to migrate outside Goa and even India, for better work opportunities. This resulted in drastically reducing the Christian population in the Old Conquests.</p>
<p>But in spite of this, the Christian population in the Old Conquests continues to dominate Goan politics. In that sense, religion counts, but strangely, it doesn’t matter in terms of religious fanaticism, which we witness in the rest of India. Being locals, Christians do count a lot socially and culturally in their own village or town, when it comes to choosing a candidate. But it doesn’t necessarily matter. The instances below prove this point.</p>
<p>In 1972, the strongly Christian-dominated seat of Benaulim village was won by Vasudev Sarmalkar on the UGP ticket by defeating the former Benaulim MLA Elu Miranda, who had contested as an independent. Sarmalkar polled 77 per cent votes while Miranda could poll only one per cent. Due to Sarmalkar’s sudden death two years later, a by-election was held in 1974. To everybody’s surprise, Luta Ferrao, standing on an MGP ticket, won the by-election by just ‘two votes’ against Dr Wilfred de Souza, the UGP candidate. When the results were contested, the court ruled in Dr Willy’s favour. But the MGP winning in a UGP stronghold was a stunning event in the political world of Goa. If the MGP was considered to be the party of Hindus, then how could it defeat a strongman like Dr Willy in the UGP stronghold of Salcete? If religion was not the criteria, then what was it? We will examine this crucial factor in detail later.</p>
<p>The same Dr Wilfred de Souza, who was considered Dr Jack de Sequeira’s successor as the chief Christian leader, created more history. After a short stint with the UGP in Benaulim, he joined the Congress (Urs) along with other UGP colleagues and won the seat from Calangute in 1980. All of them then shifted to the Congress (Indira). Having developed differences with the party leaders, Dr Willy split to form the Goa Congress to contest the 1984 election, but lost to MGP’s Shrikant Malik from Calangute. All his candidates, except Luizinho Faleiro from Navelim, lost the battle. With Goa attaining Statehood and the number of constituencies rising to 40, this Christian leader shifted his base to Saligao, a neighbouring constituency with Hindu dominance. Subsequently, Dr Willy, known as the ‘Political Bishop’ in political circles, won four consecutive elections from Saligao, twice as a Congressman, once on the Goa Rajiv Congress ticket and then with the Nationalist Congress Party. After losing the 2007 election to BJP’s Dilip Parulekar, he shifted to the much ‘safer’ constituency of Aldona in 2012, this time under the Trinamool Congress. But that brought about the end of his career, with Glen Ticlo defeating him on the Hindutva party BJP’s ticket. Dr Willy polled hardly 643 votes, a mere three per cent!</p>
<p>Shaikh Hassan Haroon is yet another fascinating example from the Hindu-dominated Mormugao constituency. When this former judge and learned man contested for the first time in 1977 on a Congress ticket, the Muslim population of Mormugao was just nine per cent.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> He defeated former MGP MLA Vasant Joshi, a leading businessman of Vasco city in whose house the highly revered deity Lord Damodar of the port town is worshipped. Shaikh Hassan was the five-time MLA of Mormugao till 1999, having suffered just one defeat in 1994 against Independent MLA John Manuel Vaz. Even today, the Muslim population of Mormugao is not more than 16 per cent. John Manuel Vaz and his son Karl also represented this Hindu-dominated constituency.</p>
<p>Curchorem is yet another inspiring example of the harmony existing in Goa’s political arena. The first Muslim legislator Abdul Razak entered Goa Assembly from this constituency in 1967 on the UGP ticket, when the community of this local petrol pump owner was hardly two per cent. The tradition continued with Congress candidate Dominic Fernandes getting elected from this Hindu-dominated constituency twice, in 1989 and 1994. At that time, in Curchorem, Hindus comprised 68 per cent, Christians 24 per cent and Muslims 8 per cent.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> Then came Nilesh Cabral of the BJP, who is a two-time MLA since 2012. Today, it is 62 per cent Hindus, 29 per cent Christians and 9 per cent Muslims<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>
<p>From the time Taleigao was constituted in 1989 after Statehood was attained, it has been consistently proving that religion and even caste simply don’t matter in politics. Somnath Zuwarkar, a Hindu Saraswat Brahmin, served this constituency for the first three terms (1989-94-99) as a Congress candidate by defeating the MGP candidate twice and the BJP once. At that time, Taleigao consisted of 63 per cent Hindu Bahujan Samaj and 26 per cent Christians.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> The sizeable Gauda Christian community strongly stood behind their Bhau for three consecutive terms. Then came the Monserrate-Raj, starting from 2002. Babush Monserrate won Taleigao twice on the UGDP ticket and then his wife Jennifer won twice on the Congress ticket. During these two decades, Taleigao has overgrown as a twin city of Panaji with hundreds of housing complexes and thousands of Goans as well as middle class people and migrant labour from outside residing here. As of today, the strength of the Christian community has slipped down to one-fourth. Hindus have grown to 19,999 (66 per cent), out of which 2000 are migrant labour. Muslims are not more than 2500 (9 per cent). BJP’s consistent attempts to win this Hindu-dominated constituency have failed miserably. The Hindutva party has now helplessly embraced both Monserrate husband and wife into the party fold.</p>
<p>There is yet another Taleigao man, who created history in his ancestral village, Loliem-Pollem in Canacona, on the border of Goa. Known as Ponjekar Diogacho Cheddo (Son of Diogo from Panaji), Isidore Fernandes won the hearts and votes of the Poinguinim people. Defeating four-time tribal legislator Vasu Paik Gaonkar and sitting MGP MLA Jagdish Acharya, in 1999, he rose as an Independent MLA. He then won two more elections on Congress tickets in 2002 and 2017, only to then jump out to join the BJP during both the terms. With a Christian community of barely 18 per cent compared to 80 per cent Hindus, he enjoys a strong base among the tribals in Gaodongri and Khotigao as well as among the Hindus.</p>
<p>There are many such tales in Goa’s electoral arena which prove beyond doubt that religion does count in Goa, but does not matter when it comes to electing your representative. Sometimes it is the party or sometimes the ‘performing’ candidate.</p>
<h2 id="the-media-cannot-take-voters-for-a-ride">The Media Cannot Take Voters for a Ride</h2>
<p>The media has played a vital role in Goan politics right from the first election held in 1963. As per the 1961 census, Goa’s literacy rate at that time was 30 per cent, 1.93 lakh out of 6.27 lakh population. Just one per cent of the population had studied till SSC or above. Today, in the 2011 census, it is 87 per cent, a big leap in the field of education.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Goa has a rich history of print media right from the pre liberation days. Despite the Portuguese imposing all kinds of curbs on civil liberties and freedom of expression, where even a wedding card had to go through a censor, Goa’s intellectual freedom fighters were fearlessly publishing periodicals from Bombay and circulating them in Goa in a secretive manner. To skip the censor of printed material, some were even circulating handwritten periodicals. The languages used were Konkani, Marathi, English, and Portuguese. However, except for a couple of ‘controlled’ Portuguese newspapers, no other daily newspaper existed in Portuguese Goa.</p>
<p>To counter the official Portuguese radio, Emissora de Goa, two young freedom fighters Vaman Sardesai and Libia Lobo were operating a tri-lingual secret underground radio service for Goans from the forest across the Goa border. The services run from a moving truck since 1955 were called Voz de Liberdade in Portuguese, Goenche Sodvonecho Awaz in Konkani, and the Voice of Freedom in English. The periodicals as well as the underground radio service played a crucial role in shaping the opinion of Goans to fight for liberation.</p>
<p>The first Assembly election of 1963 was covered by four newspapers: O Heraldo, a Portuguese daily; A Vida, a Portuguese English-Konkani daily; The Navhind Times, an English daily; and Gomantak, a Marathi newspaper. While O Heraldo was limited to the highly educated and limited Portuguese readership, the A Vida owner was the Congress candidate, as was the owner of The Navhind Times. Hardly any propaganda-related news of the UGP appeared in The Navhind Times though A Vida used to carry articles by pro-UGP writers. And Gomantak, the sole Marathi newspaper owned by mine owner Chowgule, was also carrying the propaganda news of the Congress. The MGP was boycotted by all the mainstream newspapers. In spite of this, Goan voters wiped out the Congress, the UGP emerged as the opposition party, and the ‘boycotted MGP’ emerged victorious. The bombardment of news of the Congress meetings and articles had absolutely no impact on Goan readers in the 1963 election.</p>
<p>The scenario was exactly the opposite in 1967 during the Opinion Poll, the referendum held on 16 January 1967. It had turned into a literal war of words through newspapers. The anti-merger activists had started Rashtramat, a Marathi newspaper in September 1964, to convince the Hindus how the merger of Goa into Maharashtra would be suicidal. It was founded with the support of five mine owners, primarily to counter the pro-merger propaganda of Goa’s Gomantak and the Maharashtra based newspapers and periodicals coming to Goa. The Portuguese and Konkani (in Roman script) newspapers, though strongly opposed to the merger, had readership restricted to the Christian community. Rashtramat played wonders in turning the tables and persuading a large community of Hindu population to vote against the merger.</p>
<p>The war of opinions between Gomantak and Rashtramat stands as one of the most glorious clashes in the history of the Indian media, from a readership point of view. The mindset of the Hindus, especially the non-Brahmin Bahujan Samaj, was shaped by the articles and editorials published in both these newspapers. Uday Bhembre’s daily column Brahmastra was read by all the pro-mergerists. In a three-and-a-half-hour long marathon interview on the Opinion Poll, Uday-bab told me that he changed the aggressive tone of his Brahmastra when they realised that people of Goa were in a mood to understand the issue before making up their mind. Ramakant Khalap recalls that even in his pro-merger stronghold of Mandrem, people used to sit around with one person reading out Brahmastra and the others listening and then discussing the pros and cons of the merger. My father was one of the main leaders of the pro merger movement in Canacona. I started reading Rashtramat and Gomantak at home in my childhood.</p>
<p>Since then, Goa has been witnessing this <em>Ajeeb</em> mindset of the Goan readers. People read newspapers, but with an analytical mind. They have proved umpteen times that they can not only read but can also read between the lines and act wisely. Campaigns led by newspapers to topple governments have failed miserably. The media, on the other hand, has also played a monumental role in embarrassing the governments on burning public issues like the agitation for official language, the infamous molestation of a girl employee by the Speaker of Assembly, and the protest against the destructive regional plan in 2006.</p>
<p>India’s first Right to Information Act came into force in Goa in 1997 through a campaign carried out by the news media. All the political parties in the then Assembly − the Congress, the MGP, the BJP and others − unanimously passed the RTI Bill, which also inserted a provision to strangulate the free voice of the media. The Goa Union of Journalists and the Goa Editors’ Guild came out on the roads along with other social activists against this draconian clause. A recent example is the Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill passed by the BJP government without placing the actual facts for discussion and without allowing debate in the House. The media tore the bill to pieces. Civil society opposed it too. In both these cases, the government had to freeze the bills and allow them to lapse.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that people get influenced by whatever the media says. Much before the paid news phenomenon hit the newspaper industry at a national level, Goa was the first state to experiment with it in the 2007 Assembly election. Goa’s leading newspapers were publishing two, three, and even four pages (including the front page) full of paid news published with by-lines of non-existent journalists. These sponsored efforts had absolutely no impact on the voters.</p>
<p>Today, in the changed technological scenario, Goa has four English newspapers, seven Marathi and one in Konkani – a total of 12 dailies for a population of just 15 lakhs. In addition, there are six local cable TV channels running at the state level and another six to seven digital platforms. Political parties and politicians are desperately trying to either manage the media or ‘help’ them financially to remain in the news. Some parties like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have made generous financial provisions for media management, besides social media. Similar is the case with Prashant Kishor’s IPAC team and his ‘client’, the Trinamool Congress.</p>
<p>But a veteran Goan professional who has been handling media management for around two decades tells me that such management cannot succeed beyond introducing and branding the candidate or the party. It cannot reach the level of translating into votes. The voters have their own calculations to decide which ‘brand’ to favour. They judge the credibility of the media by ‘reading between the lines’ and not on its face value. How they judge, how seriously they take the media and on what basis they decide their vote is still a mystery to many politicians, and even the political parties. On the other hand, the credibility of the media is now at stake.</p>
<p>This book attempts to examine all these <em>Ajeeb Karname</em> and try to find out the reality hidden behind the Goan voters. Why do Goans appear strange? Because they don’t behave like other Indians? Are they following the right path? Or a path that Indian democracy is not familiar with? What are the hidden truths behind this so-called <em>Ajeebi</em>, this strangeness?</p>
<p>We will try to find answers to all these questions by examining them in a rational manner and with a perspective based on the socio-economic conditions and the culture that has produced the Goan psyche. To perceive this we need to study, comprehend, and analyse the history, geography, economics, and the social fabric of Goa, right from the time the Konkan coastline originated 12,000 years ago till date. Let us begin this journey.</p>
